    "Title":"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",
    "Content":"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the \/r\/depression and \/r\/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt\/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

    "Content":"Welcome to \/r\/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/about\/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/wiki\/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/wiki\/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

    "Content":"Hi all,\n\nI graduated from university some months ago and have been looking for a job since. I haven't been able to find one, even though I do get some interviews (mostly for jobs not related to my field of study).\n\nI'm living at home with my parents (during uni I used to live away from home). At the start of the job search, I didn't feel too bad, but it's been quite a while now and I've started feeling heavier and heavier inside. I'm questioning my dreams, my future and wondering what life really has to offer.\n\nI've also begun feeling like maybe I just can't hack life. Like it's all too much for me, like I wasn't built for it. The thought of going to work and coming home, going to work and coming home everyday for the rest of my life just sucks the air out of me (and getting a job is ironically my main goal at the moment). I just want to lay down and not get up. \n\nIt's especially painful because I used to be very ambitious and expect a lot from myself (which I still do, making the contrast between my actual situation and my dreams especially jarring).\n\n I'm not suicidal. I want to live, desperately, but I don't feel fit for it.\n\nI also feel guilt towards my partner because he is quite successful in his field, and then there's me: a girl with no job and student debt who lives at home. Lol.\n\nAnyway, what I came here to ask is if any of you have advice on how to get out of this headspace.\n\nI'm thinking that my two options are:\n\nA) Getting a new education unrelated to my interests and passions and spend the rest of my days working that job (maybe it's not so bad, what do I know).\n\nB) Doubling down on my (artistic) long shot dreams. Maybe going traveling to try to \"find myself\" or at least some beauty somewhere.\n\n\n\nThanks<3\n\n",

    "Content":"\nHey guys, I just created this account today not very computer savvy so please be nice and don\u2019t yell at me. Constructive criticism would be great. The last few days I was just been looking for places where I can talk about my problems with people I don\u2019t know. So here it goes I am a 42-year-old single mother of 5. Not sure where to start, but I\u2019ll stop blabbing. I\u2019ve been a single mother for a long time and me and my kids are great. They are very well loved and taken care of. I moved out of my family house since I was 17 I knew by 14 I was super independent. I wanted to go out really fast so by 17 I have two jobs.\nAnd I was able to afford my own apartment \nFast-forward being that I always wanted to be independent I struggled a lot. Also having kids early. But the hustle inside me was always able to push through. We didn\u2019t have a lot but always food and a roof overhead until five years ago. I opened my business and it just went nuts. I was very lucky.\nAfter two years of being in business, I was financially able to buy my first house. Man, you guys don\u2019t know how excited I was. For the first time in my life, I was able to look at my kids and say this is our home now nobody can kick us out in a year because they wanna sell it. We don\u2019t have to move anymore. I know some of you are like whatever it took you 30 something years to buy your own house when most people nowadays are buying houses at 20 lol but I\u2019m still proud of myself. Here\u2019s a stupid part. I was so excited to buy this house that I definitely didn\u2019t think it through. I put all my savings into this house, down payment, etc.. my mortgage is 6000 that\u2019s with insurance, etc.. at 7 1\/2% rate. I know everybody is probably screaming at me right now.. at that time part of me was just so excited and I was making over 250k  a year. So I thought it was good even though I had used all my savings. Two months later after moving into the house. I was diagnosed a chronic disease and wasn\u2019t able to work anymore. That time it wasn\u2019t so bad I was still able to kind of function, but not do what I used to do. I\u2019ve been doing nails for over 20 years. I decided I was going to take my money I sold from my salon and do a online business at home which I was pretty excited about because around that time is when my youngest son was diagnosed with autism so I had to hire a therapist. Come five days a week at home and I need to be there anyways.. will a month later I can barely stand now. If you ask anybody that knows me the first thing they will tell you that I\u2019m strong hardheaded I will not let anything stop me. but now just laying in my bed for two weeks now I\u2019m defeated. I\u2019m weak, embarrassed, and again I failed my kids. I just left a voicemail to my realtor saying that I need to sell the house because I can no longer afford it. i\u2019m just speaking on how I feel I\u2019m not gonna act on it so don\u2019t worry, but this is my first time in my life that I actually was thinking to myself, man if I can just sleep tonight and not wake up and have to face my kids and tell them. My older daughter is in college. Her friend expressed to me that she has been so stressed out about me that she wants to quit college and come help me. I had told her when I got sick cause I knew she was gonna do that. The absolutely no way she\u2019s going to quit her schooling. I wasn\u2019t able to go to college so should we be the first one in the family going to college. I will not let her take my burden anymore because she had to pick up my slacks back then and be a second mother to the little ones I promised her five years ago that I\u2019m gonna make up those years for her and she will be a kid again. Now this? I\u2019m so sorry this was a long one, but I really needed to talk this out before I went crazy and have other thoughts. I\u2019ve been stuck on my bed for a week now I\u2019ve lost 15 pounds in a week, but I\u2019m so scared to talk to my doctor or go to the ER because I know like last few times they\u2019re gonna try to convince me to do my heart surgery to replace a valve. I know this sounds crazy to you guys that I\u2019m not doing that but I have my reasons financially and emotionally. I\u2019m just not ready for it yet with my disease. My recovery time would be at least twice if everything goes well I have to make sure that my home and my kids are all going to be OK for at least two months when I\u2019m down. I would appreciate some insight or even just a air hug. thank you for listening.",

All i do is escape, escape, escape. I feel as if theres like some bad feeling thats always present chewing in the back of my mind so i have to distract myself to not notice it. I feel so pathetic and i feel as if im constantly getting judged even if im by myself. I cant look in the mirror without feeling disgusted. Theres just always something to worry about, always something. I always have to feel bad and i hate it so much. Its so stupid. My social anxiety is genuinely affecting my life. I cant even talk to people properly. And i know its dumb but im stressing out over 3 presentations that i have to do. Its so stupid and so insignificant but i really, really dont want to get yelled at. I cant even talk to my cousins or my sister without feeling like a fucking weirdo. Everyone seems to have their shit together and i know thats not the case but i cant helpt but think that everytime i talk to someone. Sorry this is so incoherent and long.

    "Title":"Feeling depressed as a response to an irrefutably depressing situation. Where is the line drawn between a normal response and clinical depression?",
    "Content":"For context, I\u2019ve spent a decade of my life with a single minded focus to get into med school, got to the finish line with an offer in my hands, but couldn\u2019t accept it because we couldn\u2019t afford it since my family was going through an abrupt and unexpected period of financial hardship. Efforts to find scholarships were unsuccessful and I\u2019ve had to let the offer lapse. \n\nThis experience sent me on a downward spiral towards suicidal ideation. A little dramatic, maybe, but through my adolescence and early adulthood, that goal made up the entirety of my identity. I didn\u2019t know who I was without it. In my formative years as a child, things happened, and I was fixed on the idea that I have to be successful to protect the people that I loved (alongside a genuine passion for med). That was all I wanted to do, all I lived for. And so for a long time, that was all of me, and my needs and my wants were always secondary to this ultimate goal. Naturally, I was entirely lost, with no recognition of who I was without it and at the same time, feeling immensely guilty that I will amount to nothing but a burden to the people I wanted to protect, who still believe in me when I have nothing to show for it. \n\nI spent most of the last year in a depressive slump. I\u2019d imagine myself climbing out of a window, or wishing the ceiling would collapse on me, or other ways that I can go and finally free myself from what I felt was a meaningless and burdensome existence. Sometimes I refused to eat to feel like I\u2019m still in control of my life. I\u2019d avoid calling my family because it would remind me of how I failed them and because I couldn\u2019t hold it together in front of them, and they didn\u2019t deserve to see that. I\u2019d pendulum swing between frantically trying to find an alternative plan, and trying to sleep my days away because I refused to participate in life. No suicide attempts were made, and I realise this is very much a form of escapism that many people experience. \n \nThrough this, I feel like I\u2019ve come to know a depth to myself, or more specifically, my sadness. I\u2019ve become a little numb to it all, and in the instances where I\u2019ve tried to force myself to cry, almost procedurally, just to get the sadness to go away so I can go on with my day, i find that the tears do not come. Instead it sits in my chest pushing outwards on my ribcage and hovering just enough that I will always be on edge for when something finally cracks. Since coaxing it gently doesn\u2019t work, my mind dived to the deep end and entertained self harm as an option for relief, but was able to persuade myself against it. It feels like an amorphous being, a familiar stranger who breaks into your home, eats from your pantry, sleeps in your bed and refuses to leave. It always comes back, at abrupt times, at the slightest trigger, and I now know to expect it when I\u2019ve felt well for too long. \n\nI can\u2019t afford therapy. So if a lovely stranger were to stumble upon my post, can someone please tell me if this is normal. I mostly understand that I\u2019m experiencing depression, the feeling, not the disorder. I am having an emotional response to an obviously depressing situation. But why does it keep visiting me abruptly, on perfect days when I\u2019m perfectly happy, when I think I\u2019ve made peace with the the fact that things don\u2019t work out like I expect because that is simply in the nature of things. I\u2019m so tired of holding my breath waiting for it to go away. This a personal curiosity, what is the difference between this and clinical depression? ",

So my voice has adjusted to that.\n\nRecently, I've started getting better at handling my anxiety. It's not gone - it never will be, I've come to accept that - but I've been able to handle it better in recent years. I'm even able to talk more confidently and proudly, with strangers.\n\nOne thing I've always struggled with though is the sound of my own voice, both thanks to my own insecurities and bullying over the years. Usually I don't mind it, but occasionally I get self-conscious, or if I hear myself on recording, I cringe. I sound nasally, awkward, like the stereotypical nerd, and I've gotten comments asking if I'm a dude\u00a0*(I'm a 24 yr. old girl)*\u00a0and if I'm autistic, in the insulting way.\n\nJust today, on a game I play, Valorant, my voice got called the most annoying thing in the world and to never speak again. Usually I can just laugh, hit back, and brush it off - which I played it off like I did - but deep down, it's hitting hard, and I hate myself for wanting to cry, especially from an insult from a dude I know I'll never see again. I usually have tougher skin, especially on a stupid & toxic game like Valorant, but today, it's just hurting, and I want to follow the \"advice\" and never speak again.\n\nI wish I could gain confidence in my voice. I used to have a very pretty one, along with a pretty singing voice. It used to be called unique. Now I just hate hearing myself speak. I don't know what to do.",

    "Content":"Hey y'all I hope I can get some support and advice here as I am really lost and confused and severely depressed and its reached a new low for me. so I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a very long time. I believe I first noticed something was off with me when I was a sophomore in high school. To put that in perspective, I am 22 now and a junior in college.\n\nTo get straight to the point, I truly feel like I've hit rock bottom due to my mental health taking notable declines in the past couple years. I'm not graduating this semester like I was supposed to because I've been having to retake classes because there's a lot of days where I feel so heavy and disinterested in life that I don't even show up and I just rot in my room all day. I barely have any friends in the city I live in right now, and I'm broke and finding a job is so hard because the market sucks. It's crazy because I used to be such a bright eyed ambitious guy who never failed a class and always excelled; I literally came to college with the dream of becoming a doctor. but 3 years later now my gpa is well below a 2.0 and I don't even have that same passion anymore and have no clue what I want to do in terms of my career. Also, I hate being gay, its brought me nothing but hardship and awful heartbreaking things in my  life. I don't come from the most accepting family and I remember my dad telling me in middle school that I would go to hell and god hates me for being gay; mind you, I hadn't even fully discovered or come to terms with my sexuality at that time.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I have had suicidal thoughts. They are mostly passive right and not overwhelming , like im not actively thinking about taking my life. But sometimes I imagine something happening to me that would remove me from this world because existing as me is so hard. I had a therapy visit a few weeks ago and for the first time I had to ponder when my therapist asked me if I had ever had suicidal thoughts. I try to imagine a future for myself and it's just blank in my head, and I can't imagine making it past 24 or 25. I have so much love inside of me but I never feel it. One of my closest guy friends who I met freshman year of college ( I will admit I had \/ have a little feelings for him) showed me his true colors and discarded me and stopped talking to me as much in light of someone new entering his life and its also been taking a tole on me because I prioritize him and I deeply care about our friendship but its clear he doesn't. This past year has been the hardest and he wasn't there for me through any of it, and I tried to reconnect with him recently but it was honestly a mistake because its clear he still doesn't care that much or have any remorse for switching on me, and it breaks my heart. If only he knew how close to the edge I am. he willingly missed my birthday, but I still reached out on his birthday even though I was going through the most traumatizing stuff around that time. He's admitted that he knows he hasn't been a good friend but he didn't even try to say sorry to me when I expressed how I felt about him giving me distance when all I wanted was his company. I feel like I have no one. the people I expected love from gave me the opposite. I haven't spoken to my brother in almost a year because around this time last year while I was visiting home from college, he punched me in my face and called me a faggot, and I still haven't gotten an apology or anything. It really fucked me up mentally and it still is.\n\nI'm not happy at my childhood home but im also not happy at the school or city im in right now. I low-key regret coming here and meeting the people that I did, even that close guy friend who was so special to me. I have absolutely no hope for my future whether it be a few months from now, 1 year from now, or even 10 years. Even when \"good\" things happen to me, I still feel that raincloud above my head and I more days than not I just don't want to be here. everything feels gray even though people tell me I add color to their lives. they try to remind me of all the awesome things ive accomplished and how much of a good person I am with a beautiful personality, but I don't feel it.\n\nI have a lot more to say, but i already feel like this post is pretty lenghty and packed so I'll leave it here.

I have a part-time job to pay for living and studying (super-boring, low-wage, but better than nothing?). I would love to earn a living with IT, but my lack of patience is just killing everything I do to get there some day. I have struggled with depression before, was considering suicide 3 years ago, met my partner 2 years ago. It's becoming obvious I am somewhere in the spectrum with ADHD or smth, but I can't get no help from anywhere. I am a mess most of the time, these days. Supposed to get married next year, bc I love my partner, but honestly I constantly feel like giving up (or faking my death and fleeing to the wilderness somewhere bc I am constantly ashamed of myself...).",

    "Content":"I don't really know where to start tbh. Years ago I used to think that if I got help, started therapy, got some sort of meds, that I'd slowly start to heal but now that I'm here I just. idk. I don't take my meds anymore because just one look at them makes me want to puke. Not because they don't work or give me awful side effects. No they are literally perfect. For some reason there's some sort of block in my brain and I just don't take them because I'm disgusted at them. They helped my ocd and 'smoothed out' my depression I don't really know why i stopped taking them. I've tried to start taking them again a few times but it never worked out, I'm trying again since yesterday. I don't really tell my therapist things. I know many things I could talk about with her and i know what I should work on but I never do? And then I'm annoyed at myself for wasting money and I feel like recently my therapist has been annoyed by me too (its stupid and irrational ik). Because of my severe anxiety I'm on an individual learning path at school but I feel like that isn't the only reason I wanted them? Even now I'm tired of having to idk. I have like 3 lessons a day and even then I'm too exhausted and overwhelmed. My teachers are annoyed at me and so is my mother since she worked hard for me to have this. And I feel bad whenever i skip a lesson. I thought that I wanted to just live normally, go to school and study. And i still want that but even now when its so much easier i just cant. I don't know why. Im also back in piano class. I thought i wanted it but when i come back home from it i just don't have the strength to actually practice. i also have a few hobbies that i really like but i do them so rarely. i have so many ideas and plans but i do them so rarely. the main thing i do is wake up do nothing and sleep. and its not like i don't want to do anything but when i pick up smth i just don't feel anything. my mom is so tired of me sometimes she threatens me with stuff like if u skip anymore lessons you're not going to that concert but I've done worse things to myself for skipping lessons. as I've said i feel guilty but i still don't study, i don't do my homework, i oversleep or curl up in bed from anxiety. anxiety from what??? its literally just a lesson i don't know what I'm so stressed about. i also have a friend whos really dear to me and i consider them the best person I've ever met but lately I've been distancing myself from everyone and while usually that doesn't include them lately i just don't know what to say except complain because what is really going on in my life now? oh yeah i want to learn a language but if i actually commit to it ill drop it haha or I've been laying in bed the whole day like what am i supposed to say. i want to hang out so hard but all i do is be negative. i also made a new friend for the first time in a long time but yeah I've been distancing myself from them i don't know why. i like them and i like spending time with them but for some reason I've been giving them reasons to leave me. everyone in my life leaves me at one point (because of me an the way i am) and i get it i get it really but I want to be a better friend but i just don't know how. or more like i know how but i just cant do it i always go back to the state i was in. its always like this with everything. i want to do something but the second i start i just don't have the strength to continue. I don't think I'm going to pass this year and i WANT to but I'm not putting in any effort either. not grades wise no I'm getting top marks whenever i actually attend its that i don't show up. id kill myself for being a burden but i know that this isn't it. this isn't all life could be. and that if i die now ill never experience all that. I've almost killed myself twice and those experiences only feed this. which is not bad i think that these problems are all temporary and that death would be an overreaction but some part of me thinks that i deserve it. and logically it would solve every problem. i really am a burden the way i am and the solution for that is to change but i just don't know how. i don't think i actually wrote what i meant to here but this is also something i guess.",

    "Content":"First and foremost, please excuse my poor English; I'm still learning.\n\nI feel a deep desire to die. Every day I wake up with a shred of motivation, but as the day progresses until night falls, I only feel desolation and profound sadness. The worst part is that I have no reason to feel sad. I have a loving family, a loving boyfriend, a not-so-stable remote job (but it exists), and I have two college degrees, but still, I feel empty.\n\nI wake up several times during the night wanting to cry, anxious, and afraid. And I can't even enjoy things I usually enjoy, like reading and listening to music. No matter how hard I try to distract myself, sadness takes over and won't let me live in peace. Absolutely everything makes me cry; even as I'm writing this, tears are flowing. Sometimes I fantasize about having an accident and dying, because I don't have the courage to take my own life. I want to rip my heart out and feel absolutely nothing, never feel sadness again.\n\nI attended therapy for a while and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. After a few weeks, I stopped going because I felt it wasn't helping me. My partner suggested I see a psychiatrist again, but I'm too afraid of having to take medication and depend on it to feel better. Despite all this sadness that never goes away, I insist on having hope that one day I'll feel better. I try to console myself with the thought that this sadness will be temporary and that I'll soon be able to live peacefully. But I've been feeling so bad for so long that I'm worried I'll never regain my stability.\n\nI don't want to die. I feel terribly bad, but I don't want to stop living. People who have been on medication for depression, you felt dependent on those medications? What happens when you don't take them? I want to know so I can be sure whether I want to start treatment with medication or not.\n\nThank you, and sorry for the long post.",

    "Title":"Some Considerations",
    "Content":"This post is not meant to be a solution to everything.  But, it has a small story, some concepts worth considering, and it may offer help.  Some of it is subjective, as it comes from a personal viewpoint.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget when I was young and I did a fairly arduous hike to reach the tallest cliff in my area, with plans to jump off it.  Upon reaching the top, my brain was naturally supplied with endorphins and what-not, from the exercise, sunlight, nature, and fresh air.  Furthermore, atop the mountain, I overlooked the valley below, which gave me wider perspective on things.  Naturally, I was scared to jump off and end everything, yes, but I also had an improved mood.  I sat there for awhile, reframing my life.  I decided it\u2019s better to live, and to just not take life as seriously, since the other option was death, which is permanent.  This mindset actually led to some pretty radical behavior, which caused me to eventually become a heavy drug and alcohol user.  Those behaviors had very negative effects, and I somehow managed to become clean and sober.  Now my drug of choice is coffee in the morning, chewing tobacco (which i wish i could quit), and exercise.  \n\nExercise is so amazing.  It literally releases the same brain chemicals that heavy drugs do, and it has an intense effect on the mind.  For those with the ability, the more high-intensity the more \u201cfeel good\u201d chemicals that get released.  My addiction to exercise has caused me to be quite physically healthy, and helps my depression and anxiety.  It also instills a sense of accomplishment, as well as gives me goals for further improvement.  However, the trick to exercise is to enjoy it for its short term, mood-boosting effects, and allow any physical effects to occur as a byproduct.  \n\nThe same goes for happiness.  The trick is to live a virtuous life, with good actions, in every realm, and allow happiness to occur as a byproduct; rather than fixate on and chase happiness.  Happiness is usually not an over-joyous moment, but a calm and content one.  And, happiness also occurs during moments of reflecting on things you are grateful for, both small and big.  I have lower back issues, so exercise can be challenging at times, and i understand others may have health issues that restrict the ability to exercise.  However, most people can at least go on gentle walks, which are very powerful.  Also, there is a wheelchair-bound man who goes to my local gym, everyday, and completes many various exercises that he\u2019s able to perform.  I understand some may not be able to do gentle walks, or act like the wheelchair man at the gym, and that is not cause to give-up.  I\u2019m not saying exercise is a cure all  - only that it is powerful.  \n\nAll that said, I am the same as some of the people here who have dark thoughts.  I think about death all the damn time.  What concerns me, is that i personally believe death leads to nothingness, and i\u2019d rather experience something, rather than nothing.  Death will arrive, in due course.  I wonder if i\u2019ll be calm and content when I\u2019m on my deathbed, or if i\u2019ll regret all my years of suicidal ideation, and will grasp at life with tears streaming down my face.  \n\nI wish anyone who reads this well.  And, I hope for you the ability to take specific physical and mental actions to improve your life.  The brain has an ability to evolve and change - to literally rewire itself.  It\u2019s called neuroplasticity.  It\u2019s worth learning about, reflecting on, and harnessing the power of.  (TLDR: Too Long. Diligently Read.)",

    "Title":"Feeling suicidal with kids",
    "Content":"6 months ago, things were pretty good. I considered myself a pretty good mom to my 9 and 10 year old who I love with every ounce of my being. I was doing really well in a challenging, but stressful job. Kids had extra curriculars and I volunteered at thier school when I could. Money was in order and spent freely within reason.\n\nI never had any real depression, just anxiety and plenty of it. I was medicated for that. Fast forward to November and I got really sick. I slept for almost 24 hours, then could barely sleep for days. I became very manic ( new to me) and then psychotic. My husband shielded the kids from seeing as much of that as he could and I went into the psych ward for a week. \n\nThere, they diagnosed me with bipolar. My mother had it, but I was still skeptical of the diagnosis because I was 40 with no prior symptoms. After being released from the hospital, I took a leave of absence from work to do a CBT program for mood disorders. I felt like myself.\n\nIn December I started feeling depressed. I had never felt that before. It got worse and I made it to the day after my 9 year old's birthday before going back to the hospital with suicidal thoughts. That stay was a bit of a joke. I've also been working with a psychiatrist and we are on medication number 6, I think. \n\nEveryday I think about suicide. From the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, 97% of my thoughts are just sad. How I'm not well and can't be the mom I was before. How I am so overwhelmed by everything. How hard it is to put on a normal face for the kids, though they see me in bed more than I would like. Getting up on the mornings is the hardest. The clock has reset until I can go to sleep again. Another day dragging my mentally and physically drained body through as many of the routines as I can manage. \n\nI keep trying to fight it with positive thoughts, but I can find no joy, no laughter. I love my kids so much and they need me. One of them is really struggling with neurodivergence. The best I am doing now is getting them up, fed, dressed, teeth and hair brushed and on the bus in the morning. I try to get something decent made for dinner and make sure they keep up on bathing, while I struggle myself.\n\nOther than that, they are getting SO much screen time. It's ridiculous and I feel like a failure. They are on thier laptops as we speak. I struggle so much to leave the house, where I use to be social. I have a well child visit for them both tomorrow and I am dreading going.\n\nI've lost 20 lbs. My face is really broken out from the current meds we are trying. None of these meds has helped so far. I feel like I'm being swept under the waves and have less strength to swim out daily. I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and losing hope that I will. \n\nI need to live for my kids. I would have already killed myself if I didn't have them. They need me. Tonight I went down a thought path that they may be better off with someone else than this shell of their old mom. We use to dance, I chaperoned their fields trips, we went places. Now I just hold it together as much as I can between sleeps. \n\nI want it to get better, I just really doubt it will at this point. Every day is hell for me. I feel completely overwhelmed, ashamed, sad for my kids, completely incapable compared to the me I was 6 months ago.\n\nI'm sorry for the long post. If anyone happens to read it, I'd love some hope. Tonight I thought of how I could word a suicide note asking family to help with the kids. They deserve more. ",

    "Content":"Lately I\u2019ve been feeling really, really depressed as the title says I genuinely feel like I\u2019m trapped inside my head and it feels like I\u2019m dying. \n\nFor some background information growing up anytime I did something wrong my parents would tell me things like \u201cthat\u2019s why nobody will ever love you\u201d and \u201cdo you really think those people (my friends) actually care about you?\u201d \n\nI try to keep myself as happy as possible because when I get sad, I don\u2019t get sad, I spiral into this deep feeling of worthlessness. \n\nThis little voice starts to tell me nobody loves me, if I try to tell myself \u201chey that\u2019s unrealistic\u201d it only works for a moment. Every. Single. Thing. Reinforces that thought. \n\nPartner not responding? They don\u2019t love you. Someone compliments me? They\u2019re saying that so you don\u2019t hurt yourself because they don\u2019t wanna feel guilty when you do it.\n\nNothing good can happen without my brain telling me I\u2019m unlovable in some way. When it gets really bad I start to get angry at everyone in my life for lying to me, they don\u2019t wanna see me, they just feel bad for me. They don\u2019t love me they\u2019re lying. Then I start to isolate myself. The feeling consumes me, I can\u2019t find a way out, I\u2019ve gone to therapy and I thought being diagnosed and treated for adhd would help but no.\n\nThis is a recurring theme for me. It\u2019s been happening ever since I can remember.\n\nBut being in a relationship has made it 1000x worse. It\u2019s making it feel so much more unbearable because that voice just keeps telling me \u201cthey\u2019re cheating on you, this is intuition not depression\u201d and I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI hope someone at least gives this a read, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for posting this. I\u2019ve never told anyone in my life this is how I feel. I think I just need to get a diary.\n",

    "Content":"I've been in a pit for the last few years. I don't know where my 20s went. Maybe it was this damn phone. Maybe it was the autism and anxiety bundle. Idk. I'm so frustrated. I spent years building a business that eventually left me in debt and failed. I still have half the debt, I do some low paying online work, i can't work a job. It literally makes me want to leave the planet. People always pick out my differences and ask me why I'm so quiet and awkward. I make about $500-$1000 a month currently. I only manage because I live minimalistic and all that goes to my car and food. My partner lives elsewhere. I don't want to live with him. He's verbally abusive. In the same breath I don't know how to leave the familiarity. He's all I've had for the last 5 years. Even if he sucks. He wants me to move in with him. I keep saying I will but I won't. I just don't know what to do. If he would magically improve I'd marry him but that's not realistic. I think I fear leaving him, I would do it. I don't have any friends or family. Everyone is gone. All I have is my dog. I live for him. Nothing makes me happy. Food does. I've put on 20lbs in the last year. It's numbing. I hate how I look now. Which further makes me not want to leave my home. The state of the world is frustrating. I have this feeling that I just want to flee but don't know what to do or where to go to feel free. If that's what I even want. Idk. I'm on lexapro, I feel no different. If I tried any substances I know I'd be a bad addict. Thankfully it's just food I guess. I just see 30 coming and I feel like my life is over. Sometimes I want that but sometimes I just wish I could be happy. I haven't been happy since childhood. Before everyone died and before I realized how bad my parents were as people. I'm so alone. Most days I don't hear anyone's voice. Just the silence of my home. It's my own prison. Idk what I'm looking for. I just didn't want to rant to my partner. ",

But it\u2019s all fugazi look in the non western world the poorest parts of the world have the least amount of killings of themselves and depressed population why? Because the values and norms built in the western world are evil men are filled with lust women are forced to be lusted and poor keeps getting poorer working more and more while the rich get richer, this whole structure of the western society is built to benefit the rich not you, you are being feed with temporary happiness with small dopamine addiction such as \u201cbed rotting\u201d  masturbation, extremely processed food made to get you addicted. To keep you happy these strategies have been used since the Roman Empire to keep a society happy you have to feed them and entertain them back then it was gladiator games and food, now it\u2019s phones lust casinos drugs ultra addictive food. You are meant to be living a simple life in a society of believing people no matter if it\u2019s Christian\u2019s Jews or Muslims because god fearing people don\u2019t harm other with ill intent. We are meant to be living in a society where people are close People have shame and people are nice we\u2019re people donate so no man sleep with an empty stomach. My advice is just give it 30 days of practicing religion I strongly recommend Islam with an open mind forget all the values the west has taught you because it\u2019s those values that have brought you here in the state that you are in. \nMay allah bless you all and keep you safe from hell fire and evil \n\nI really hope just one person can gain just a little bit of hope.

Something just re-routed inside of me and I just dont feel that excitement or happiness anymore, I think I\u2019m going to deteriorate further but it\u2019s fine, what I really can\u2019t handle though is how impaired my functionality gets. I literally cannot understand how I go from being so consistently productive and thinking sharply, to not even being able to construct a question or statement properly. it genuinely feels like I\u2019m short-circuiting because of how detached and unwell I feel, just an hour ago my housemate was talking to me and I restarted my sentence three times mid sentence and forgot what I was saying. At my NEW job I was asked to do the literal simplest task which a few weeks ago I would\u2019ve done fine, But this weird feeling in my head has been so overwhelming that I started short-circuiting and I messed it up. I\u2019m forgetting deadlines at uni, ive stopped hanging out with my friends and I can\u2019t think without detaching after a few seconds. \n\nIt genuinely makes me feel like I\u2019m brain damaged\u2026 I\u2019m definitely thinking about something that makes me feel panicked, but at the same time I don\u2019t know what about, the way these thoughts work are different than how my normal thoughts work, the only way I can describe it is it\u2019s like a shimmer of feelings and sounds looping through my head over and over again, its a noisy storm of brutal feelings and I find myself in the eye of it feeling none of it\u2026 just observing it wreak its havoc. When my mates see me how I am now they just look so confused\u2026 which is understandable because if I can\u2019t recognise myself then I really can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019d be for them, especially having seen such an energetic and happy side of me.\n\nI know I\u2019m not dumb, I\u2019m really smart actually, when I\u2019m normal I have amazing memory, I never studied during school, in high school I still got As and Bs, primary and middle school I never got under 100%. But recently I\u2019ve been getting comments that I\u2019m stupid and slow etc because of how dysfunctional I am\u2026 I can\u2019t even complaint thought because bro I AM low-key stupid right now I don\u2019t know why or what to do about this, it\u2019ll go away maybe in a few months, but for now I just need advice from anyone who has this to support myself through it. I read on Google this is associated with depression but if it\u2019s not I\u2019m sorry",

    "Content":"(26 F) I've spent the last 15 years not wanting to be alive. To spare you the nitty gritty details I had a rough childhood to say the least. Two awful, very ignorant and abusive immigrant parents who direct all their own anger and self-hatred on to you. Then to top it all off a mother who would constantly beg(s) God to \"take her\" and that she hated her life. I never really got the chance to be happy in my formative years. Once I got older, got a car, went to college I started having more freedom. Still very poor but at least getting somewhere. Tried making \"friends\" and trying my hardest to be \"normal\". That's all I've ever wanted. Despite all that I could never be happy, my family would always cloud any moments of joy I had. I'd come home to being screamed at over something that had nothing to do with me. Or my mom would demand I had to drop everything I was doing in that moment for her or my siblings or else I was a \"horrible useless daughter\". I swore that after I graduated college it would all be worth it. It wasn't.\n\nGraduated 2 years ago and I still live at home, still have no money saved, still work a dead end bullshit job.. and yes I've applied. To everything. Don't have a single person I can call a friend or just call in general. Was in 2 extremely toxic relationships with men I knew were huge red flags from day one. Wasted 6 years I could've spent actually building a real life. Like at every point in my life I either made the wrong decision or simply was wrong for existing. Everyone always lies and says \"it gets better\" in my case it hasn't and I know it won't. The ONLY reason I even made it this far is for my mother. And yes I know that sounds super crazy but I still love her. She's always tried her best for my siblings and I even if it is messed up she was never taught any better. I know if I removed myself it would kill her too, her health is already in bad shape. All her sacrifices, the least I could do was graduate and try. But I truly feel I have nothing to offer this life and this life has nothing left to offer me. \n\nI suffer from BPD and major anxiety. I've also been experiencing very long periods of depersonalization\/derealization to the point where I don't feel attached to my own body, don't feel real or awake. I have to actively tell myself \"no you can't drive into oncoming traffic\" .The world is not kind to broken people. I can't \"pretend\" well enough for hiring managers to want to even give me a second interview let alone the actual job lol. It's so debilitating to spend all your energy attempting to imitate \"normal\" that you have no room to actually be a functioning person. I genuinely see no point of continuing to exist. I'm tired. I don't care about anything. I'm a big mess. The world is a big mess. What difference does it make? I'm using up resources and energy that can be used on someone who actually matters and wants to be alive. I booked myself a cruise at the end of July. I've started mentally preparing to jump (I can't swim at all) I figure that's a good way to go. Drunk and tan :) For once I'd like to be in control of my story and I think going on a long vacation sounds very peaceful. I just worry how it would affect my mother when she realizes I'm not coming back from my trip. It feels very surreal that I'm even typing this. I don't know why I'm telling you all this, maybe part of me doesn't wanna do it I don't really know. I don't want pity I'm simply so exhausted and have no one in my life that cares. ",

    "Content":"I don't know when it started, but it's been going on consistently for at least a couple of years. But i'm definetly sure that it's getting worse. I think it started getting a lot worse about half a year ago, around when I started getting my anxiety attacks again. Ever since then i feel like i'm sinking further down a hole that i can't get myself out of.\n\nThe truth is that i hate myself, or at least being myself. It's my own fault that i'm alone, it's my own fault that i can't ever tell anyone how i feel, and it's my own fault for feeling the way i feel. I feel incredibly guilty for all the times that i've purposfully avoided people and events, even though i really wanted to. It's to the point where i hate everything about myself, the way i talk, the way i stand awkwardly and avoid eye contact. I don't  like mirrors because they remind my of how ugly i really am, i even hate walking past windows because i can see my reflection in them. And i know that i'm ugly for no other reason than bad luck, because no matter how much i take care of myself i still look the same. And it's not like my personality is any better, at least it doesn't feel like it since i have no friends or anyone to be with outside of school.\n\n  \nI just feel this intense lack of motivation and energy. It just doesn't feel like anything is worth it because it always ends the same, I realize something i don't want to know about myself and i feel even worse than i did before. It feels as though nothing can make me whole again, and i lose more and more of my confidence and motivation for every day that passes. Today I felt such an overwhelming sadness, and i wouldn't tell anyone i know this, but the whole day i felt like i was on the verge of crying because i'm so unhappy with how my life is and probably will be in the future. I would never tell anyone this because i don't think they'd understand and i'd only feel even more stupid and pathetic than i already do. ",

My dad drilled it in me that men only want one thing and I should stay away. Eventually I had boyfriends and due to what he would often say I would overthink about them taking advantage and because of my actions as a result of overthinking I ended up causing them to use me or just cut me off, in my lifetime I only had 3 relationship and two situationships the end result for most were very very horrific which caused me to become even more traumatized.

    "Content":"ATP I feel like I'm cursed and my life is destined for disaster...I'm a f22 staying in an environment that is very toxic to the point my own mother isn't talking to me. My parents divorced when I was 11years old because my father was an abusive man and I had to convince my mother to leave otherwise she would have been dead. My mother has been the only parent in my life helping me and my sister with everything whilst on the other hand my dad has literally been a dead beat who continued on with his abusive nature and married twice the first after my mother didn't work out because he was extremely abusive and beat up the wife to the point where she lost her baby and the second wife he started seeing her during his marriage to the other wife and got her pregnant and now she has 3 kids by him but he relocated to go to the UK which was my idea first during the time when they used to take a lot of people from different African countries to be healthcare assistants in the UK but he discouraged me not to go because apparently life in the UK is not easy but he ended up going using all my ideas and how I wanted to relocate and he's been going between his wife with 3 kids and his new girlfriend in the UK. He barely visited us when he was still staying in the same country as us but he affords to catch flights and visit 2year old twins who will barely remember him from the 3rd wife...so life after my parents divorce was tough and it pushed me to grow up quickly and if there are any Africans here they understand what I'm talking about. I had to be the mother my little sister didn't have and literally everything our household needed (the mechanic for our car, the maid, the gardener, the fast thinker) my mother was going through great depression at the time and I had to make sure that we pulled through and I did as she didn't want to talk to anyone and she'd stay in her room for hours sometimes putting the TV on and just staring at it even until the movie finishes without even processing or watching the movie but she eventually got out of it. Over the years that role has stuck with me being the literal parent to both my mother and sister but now I'm tired infact I've been tired a long time ago because I never experienced being a child and it took a toll on me to the point that I've tried committing suicide 8 times since I was 14. From 14 my mums mood swings started and all the rage and anger she felt for my father and even any situation she'd take it out on me and my sister always got the better end of the bargain because my mum would always baby her saying she needs most of the love as she was just 6 or 7 years when my parents divorced so she never experienced a father figure in her life. My mums relationships have been toxic to the point that she had a live in boyfriend who got her pregnant and she had a still birth but when the boyfriend discovered that my mum was pregnant he left her and she went into depression so I had to take care of her during the course of her pregnancy and I ended up now sleeping on the floor in her room and doing everything for her especially in winter her pregnancy was very demanding I'd wake up at 2am daily to make tea for her then if she wanted more blankets or socks or woolen hats I'd make sure that I'd fix everything for her but it started to take a toll on my mental health and I'd leave for school at 4am and walk alone with my thoughts and I was 16 at this time waiting to write my O level exams. I thought that after the baby was born everything was going to be fine but I wasn't even ready for the mountain that came after...my mother had a still birth at 9 months. When her boyfriend left we promised we'd take care of the baby especially me so that my mother wouldn't worry but she lost the baby and the aftermath was worse than I could ever imagine, she suffered another phase of great depression to the point where she would refuse to eat or bath and I'd do that for her and I'd still leave for school at 4am but when I'd reach school I'd start thinking about why I left home early and I should go back and be there for my mother because if she dies we have no one to take care of us. It was bad to the point that her stitches started to rot and I had to start cleaning her stitches and forcing to put medicine on them so that they heal down there and it was horrific. She would overdose medication and at one point I thought that I'd loose her but she made it. We didn't watch TV for a whole year and when we started to watch TV again we'd make sure we prewatch the movies and it would be anything without children and this happened for another year. Yes I failed my exams of course and O level results are really important especially in Africa for a person to do a meaningful course. I proceeded to go to A level and my mum  got back with the boyfriend who got her pregnant and the house was tense and it was horrible living in that environment because I had so much anger towards the man but I kept it inside and he came back with the act that he wanted to make things right and marry my mum but she fell for it and in total they dated for 7years until last year when they broke up finally I hope because she started to realize that this man wasn't going to marry her and in Africa being a single mother is shamed upon so that's why she was soooo hopeful that she'd get married and regain respect especially from her siblings. When covid happened that was the same year I was supposed to write my A level Cambridge exams but I wasn't able to the 2021 my mum came out of the blues and said that I should write my exams but I hadn't been going to school for a whole year and I wasn't doing any lessons so I ended up failing my exams again. After that whole period I've spent 4years at home I tried doing a nurse aide course so that I can go work in the UK and then study my way into becoming a nurse whilst paying for myself because I would have lessened the burden for my mum and she'd focus on my little sister so I passed with Honours and did my ielts and passed with a 7.0 band score and all these I studied on my own and did it but I failed to get a sponsor or a certificate of sponsorship to be able to work in the UK so I told my dad I needed help with talking to my grandmother to take me on her visa as she is already a UK citizen and can bring anyone as long as we use the same surname but my dad refused and instead took my whole idea and went to the UK which is where he's now living. His parents and his siblings all stay there and went when I was about 2years so if they wanted to help me they would but we don't have a close relationship so now my mum wants me to follow my passion and be a makeup artist but the fees for internationally recognized certificates are expensive and the friction we have is that all these years I've been the one telling her when the nurse aide program started I told her before a lot of countries were being red listed so that I do the course but she never saw the seriousness until her friend and children left that's when the insults came and I would start being called names and every insult and that I'm not serious with life and I'm a looser just like my father. Then I came up to her with the second idea of getting my makeup certificate and working on cruiseships but again my idea was shut down until now and then the insults started that I'm not serious with life and I'm going to end up a nobody in life just like my father and to make matters worse my little sister is starting university soon and now she thinks I'm in competition with her and that's why I am pushing for me to leave but I've honestly wanted to leave for the longest because of our living environment and people who look from the outside think we have a good life but now everything is getting worse because she's now dating a boy close to my age and she goes out almost every night after work and when she comes back home I have to make sure she's okay and if she's drunk I have to be helping her and it's been taking a toll on me and my life. My sister is happy to be leaving for university because of everything that's been happening but my mum doesn't want me to leave because even when the nurse aide thing failed she said to me maybe it's God who made you not go because he knows I need you but I'm tired I need my own life. End of 2024 I had two mild strokes and almost died and now I'm on bp medication and a bunch of other heart medication and I feel like all this has been pushed to this point because of the stresses in my life and if I try to talk to my Mum she shouts at me and makes me the bad guy to the point where now she's not talking to me. It's been 3 days of her not talking to me. I have had high blood pressure since 11 when my parents divorced but now it's getting worse and even on the meds it sometimes is still extremely high. I'm tired of everything, I have really tried but I'm tired. I just want to die. I didn't even write everything but just a small part so you guys could understand. I am tired of living, yes as a Christian I shouldn't be thinking like this but honestly I'm tired. I tried a lot of things like writing to organisations that help the less privileged so that I can get assistance in becoming a makeup artist or beauty therapist but everything has proven in vain so I'm ready to throw the towel. I'm tired of everything. ",

Based on some factors they had more access than I did however they are hard working and I don't wish them badly. \n\nHowever, I deleted my LinkedIn after seeing the post. I felt so stupid for putting myself out there. I proved that I could work for this company and by completing a contract job and they interviewed me with the promise of a higher position. \n\nI chose to go on a reddit career forum to ask what I was doing wrong hoping I could get some advice from other peers in my field. After the financial hardships in my family, losing our house and my dad's death I was trying to figure out: do I leave this field in order to financially support my aging mum? Boy, did I regret that. I got a downvote and someone unnecessarily criticizing me after asking for some constructive criticism. I answered their question and after nobody else answered my post got downvoted. So I just deleted it. This was on the brink of me finally processing a previous relationship with a guy I liked going sour. Basically he used me for sex and got bored and I realized I hadn't processed any of this. It's been nearly 18 months since that and I have had other relationships but it's like I've calcified over. Like I don't have the little child in myself that I used to. \n\n  \nI think something in me has died. Like the little kid who fought for life. I chose to start addressing the shame I felt about rejection in that relationship and my job and it has been tough. I feel a deep grief washing over me in a way that scares me because I'm not scrambling to get out of the hole anymore. It's like I don't fear the idea of death and I worry. I know I'm not a danger to myself but I worry deeply about my mental health and feel so alone. I'm sos cared that the last few years have irreparably damaged my mind and my life. All the traumas might have rewired my brain in a way that would destroy me. \n\nIn short: please help me with maybe some encouragement or anything. I'd appreciate it",

    "Content":"My girlfriend of 2 years is currently facing depression. In the past 2 months she always avidly tells me to leave her alone whenever i try and help, but she still shares all the info about what is going on in her life. Everything. She lost her friend group and tried to put stock on another friend group which eventually ended up stabbing in the back. Whenever i try to reassure her that i'm going to be here, she always doesn't want to listen and says stuff like \"you're better off without me\" or \"i'm putting too much burden on you\". \n\nIts also been a case where during the past few months, whenever i text her, she seems to always say \"you put too much energy on me, leave me alone\". Even when i try to normally converse, she says \"leave me alone\". Her depression is taking a toll on this relationship and i don't know what to do about it. I'm trying to help her but she never understands and pushes me away, what do i do?",

But regardless, I feel like depression never fully goes away. I feel like I'm always just getting through life, and recently I feel like I did before I got medicated. My life is just so shit that no meds can fix how bad it is. I can't clean my apartment. I'm a grad student and work 60+ hours a week, and come home exhausted. I haven't done any of my hobbies is ages. I can't feed myself, I can't do my laundry, I hate my apartment, I hate my clothes. Everyone at work is pushing me harder and harder and I have nothing left to give. I'm exhausted. I can't keep doing this. I cry every single day, and I just drag myself around constantly. I don't want to die but I want to disappear, to just vanish and live my life in some shadows doing whatever I want undisturbed. I know the depression never fully goes away, but I need it to be kept at bay.  ",

    "Title":"Can't bring myself to do schoolwork, Mother says its because of my phone.",
    "Content":"I've (15M), been feeling depressed for a while now, and I always feel like its my fault. For context, I feel like my depression is because of schoolwork, which has evolved into a feedback loop that makes everything worse. I've always been a top student, and have always scored high on tests and worksheets, but struggled with assignments. Lately, I've tried to voice these concerns about my mental health to my parents( not by name, but through wording like \"somethings wrong with me\"), but my mom has always told me \"Its because of your addiction to your phone\" , and while I do agree, I feel like its more than that.\n\nIt's been months since this started from a break-up, and although I do find slight enjoyment from things, such as playing soccer and being active, it\u2019s very faint compared to before. I have no energy to do things, and when I do have that energy, such as from drinking caffeine, I get distracted and do other, irrelevant things. I always sleep in class, and am easily irritable Ive stopped eating as much, and have developed a very bad habit of taking excessive amounts of painkillers when I feel especially depressive. I would much  rather do anything other than schoolwork, such as a job. I want to know how I can motivate myself to do schoolwork. The guilt of not doing these assignments, especially when my teachers, guidance counselor, and parents, all have very high expectations of me, is killing me inside, and honestly causing me to want to kill myself. It's not like the assignments are even very difficult, I just can't bring myself to do them. I want to know how I can get out, I just want some advice, even if it's tough to hear.\n\nMore background info, my family is very religious, and my parents are old and conservative, which doesn't help with the fact that I'm pretty sure I'm LGBTQ+. My mother suffered from extreme anxiety, which I'm pretty sure she passed down to me. Parents are loving, but have neglected my social growth by moving very often, and not really warning me when I needed to clean myself up and look presentable, leading to me only making real friends in 9th grade. (10th grade currently)",

    "Content":"After 10 years together and 4 years of marriage, my wife (33F) told me (33M) that she\u2019s no longer in love with me and wants to separate.\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s suffered from anxiety and depression for many years. 4 years ago, months before getting married she tragically lost her Mum very suddenly. I\u2019ve done everything I can to support her through this difficult period, but she\u2019s never really been able to come to terms with her loss. \n\nMore recently, her mental health has taken a downward spiral and she became more and more distant. When I asked what\u2019s going on, she told me that she\u2019s no longer in love with me and wants to split up. The following week she moved out.\u00a0\n\nWhen I try to talk about things, she doesn\u2019t like to open up, but has told me things like:\n\n* She doesn't feel the same anymore\n* She doesn\u2019t know what she wants in life\n* She feels guilty for being depressed\n* She's unsure if she\u2019ll ever get better\n\nDespite reassuring her that things will get better and I'll always be there for her no matter what, she's made it very clear that she still wants to split up. I suggested couples counselling and therapy, but she\u2019s not interested in either.  I\u2019ve been doing therapy myself and know how helpful it can be talking about your problems. Having done several therapy sessions herself in the past, I know she finds it mentally exhausting.\n\nI still love her and don\u2019t want to give up on our marriage, but at this stage I don\u2019t think I have any other option than to let her go\u2026 Maybe she\u2019ll come back, but it sounds like she\u2019s made up her mind already.\u00a0\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy wife of 4 years says she\u2019s no longer in love and wants to separate after years of struggling with grief and depression. She moved out, doesn't want therapy, and feels lost and guilty. I still love her but feel like my only option is to let her go. ",

    "Content":"Hi. I (20M) have been depressed since childhood. I pretty much have no friends, at least in any meaningful sense. Never been in a relationship and barley ever even talked to women. I struggle a lot socializing, I was homeschooled and very heavily sheltered and kept from socializing and having friends growing up, which makes it difficult for me to try to connect with people because it almost feels like they\u2019ve lived and I haven\u2019t. It leads me also to feel like I\u2019m \u201cbehind\u201d I guess like people won\u2019t be interested in me as friends or romantically because I\u2019m boring, have no friends or life, and like it\u2019s impossible to ever catch up. That\u2019s pretty much the emotion I feel the most I guess loneliness and like I\u2019m behind or a failure. Worst part is that there\u2019s truth to those thoughts. The worst thing though is that when I put those thoughts aside and do things to try to improve my life such as work out, eat, participate in my hobbies even though I don\u2019t get any joy from them anyway, or spend the day with someone to try to get some social interaction, I\u2019ll be in a good mood some of the day, but I always end up the last few hours of the day so upset and on the verge of tears that I can\u2019t hardly even breathe. I don\u2019t know why or what it is that causes it, but it just comes up on me all of a sudden and it\u2019s the most hopeless and desperate feeling and I hate it. It\u2019s like in that moment I just wish I was never born, like life is something for other people to live, but it was never ment for me, like I never had a chance or just am not built to handle it. I know that in time these thoughts will pass, but it\u2019s a struggle to stay on track and try to have good days when I inevitably just get reminded how empty I really am. This has been my experience today too and I just can\u2019t get to sleep, too much on my mind. I wish I could just shut it off. ",

For context he is best friends with a family friend of ours(also 36m) who lives in the same house as Becky.\n\nBecky lives with her mother's cousin (her guardian) since her mother died when Becky was 9 and she's been through alot and is very mature due to that. She gets along with older people like me and her sister(32) more than kids her own age.\n\nWithin the last 6-8 months she has befriended Joe because he also had severe depression as a child so he \"gets her\", I'm not okay with any of this. They go on day snowboarding trips alone, he's taken her driving and she sat on his lap(because \"she's short\"???). They even have plans to see a movie tomorrow night together. Becky is gay and thinks everything is 100% platonic and that Joe is like an older brother. She says nothing has ever happened and she would throw a fit and scream if he ever tried anything and I 100% believe that but it's him I am worried about.\n\nLast night I found out that when he comes over to see our family friend he says hi to Becky and checks in with her and they usually talk (with the door open). Last night he left at 5am because he \"fell asleep in Becky's room.\n\nAgain, Becky doesnt see anything wrong and I believe nothing (besides sitting on his lap driving) has happened but that doesn't mean nothing WILL happen! Advice?\n\nHer mom's cousin (Becky's guardian) said she is going to have a conversation with Joe about cutting this friendship off. I dont know how to console Becky if she finds out I'm on her guardian's side.

    "Content":"I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, I don't want to keep doing this. I don't want to live, I'm tired. \n\nI can't count the number of times I've woken up and my first thoughts are of ending things. I want peace, I want freedom, I want to stop feeling shitty all the time, I want to experience life as a better, more valuable man. I struggle to believe that's possible for me, I feel too far gone, too wrong, like life wasn't meant for me. \n\nI don't know why I never went to college, maybe I was too lazy, or too far gone with mental health. I was still able to get an okay job, with benefits and an average wage. Despite that, my upward mobility is likely non-existent, I'm going to be this forever, I'm never going to be impressive the way I would need to be to live the life I envision. I work with taxes, and regular see people paying more with a single cheque than I've ever accumulated over the course of my entire life, it's crushing. I failed financially. \n\nNot that my job is going to do me much good if the world implodes. Things just seem to get worse, life is unaffordable, populations are getting dumber and more violent and more hateful, social cohesion is dissolving, new wars are starting, the environment is screwed, scientists have noticed an asteroid. I failed to be lucky, to be born in a better time and place. \n\nI struggle socially. I have a few good friends, and I see them semi-regularly, but I'll lose them eventually and I doubt my ability to make new ones; I certainly don't have the energy or mental bandwidth. I've never been in a relationship, and as uncomfortable as it is to admit, sex is a big problem. I spent my childhood religious, learning to be deeply uncomfortable with the idea of intimacy done \"incorrectly\", and now that I've deconstructed I realize that it was never going to work for me anyway. I'm not attractive, not tall, not fit, not funny, not charismatic, not rich, not anything -\n\n- what I am is a hypocrite, being attracted to and desperately wanting experiences with women who I find exceptionally attractive while I look the way I do, without the ability to offer any kind of attractiveness in return. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not a misogynist, I don't think I'm entitled to it. I dislike and vehemently disagree with incels; they spread and perpetuate wrong and harmful rhetoric. Unfortunately the term applies to me, definitionally. If I end up leaving life behind, I hope people don't remember me as being lumped in with them. I failed to be the person I wanted to be. \n\nI don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I want out of it. I guess if nothing else, I wanted to vent. I don't believe there's anything that can help me, not in a meaningful way, to hope for that would be hoping for the impossible. \"The universe is, and we are\". It's just not a universe made for me, and I want to leave it. ",

    "Content":"I\u2019m 54. \nLooking back over the past years my life has been a domino of disasters each becoming a stronger tornado ripping my world apart leaving me with less and less to start over. \n\nHere\u2019s my life in an outline:\n1. First memory of my mom: \u201cI hate you . I wish you has never been born\u201d\n2. I\u2019m a straight A student with so much potential and love for life\n3. My narcissistic abusive mother beat me down and destroyed my self esteem. \n4. I graduate with honors and major in biological engineering \n5. Stupidity I changed to architecture. This career has been a disaster. Low salaries. Multiple layoffs from 911, the bubble burst, and COVID. \n6. In college I got pregnant in my 3rd year of architecture school by my boyfriend of 3 years I was deeply in love with. \n7. When we found out I was pregnant he said \u201cdon\u2019t expect me to marry you .\u201d\n8. He was cheating on me and I found out he had started using cocaine. \n9. I\u2019m a single mom with no support trying to finish college ALONE!\n10. After graduation a guy that was my best friend and had been since we started college together wanted us to make a go for a relationship. \n11. It was wonderful\n12. He wanted me and my daughter to move to the city he had moved to so we could take our relationship to the next level: marriage. \n13. He wasn\u2019t just a boyfriend. He was my best friend. \n14. I move. We get married in December.\n15. February the following year he says \u201cthis marriage isn\u2019t what I thought it was going to be. I want a divorce.\u201d\n16. March: me and my daughter come home to an empty house. He moved out. Wouldn\u2019t talk to me or answer the phone. \n17. I\u2019m served divorce papers at my new job where everyone knew I moved there to marry him. \n18. 2 years go by and he realizes it was a mistake and wants to marry again. \n19. We do. And vowed never to say the \u201cd\u201d word.\n20. We had almost 10 great years. Best decade of my life. We went hiking, camping, kayaking, star gazing, and many more wonderful times. \n21. 8 years later he becomes full of anger and rage. The D word comes back. He would get in my face and yell at me calling me a liar\u2026 \n22. Second divorce \n23. Time goes by and I meet a guy. We hit it off. Dated. Got married. We had a baby. After the baby was born the abuse began. It was violent. He threatened to kill me if I left him. I had to get an order of protection. I divorced him. His family is extremely wealthy. He said \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure you are financially devastated and loose your job.\u201d My current employer was friends of his parents. \n24. Divorce cost over $25,000 \n25. 4 months after our divorce was final I was fired. \n26. I take a job in my hometown. \n27. My mom tells me she wants to help me get on my feet and I can move into her home. It was empty. She was going to sell it. She married a great guy who had a home in the country. Instead of selling I could live there, pay the mortgage, when I was financially ready buy the house from her. \n28. When I  start to move in she tells me \u201cI\u2019m moving back in my house. I took a job nearby and do not want to drive from the country. You and your daughter can take one of the bedrooms. \n29. What am I going to do with my stuff?\n30. It was decided that My now grown first daughter would move into my home and I would leave my things there. \n31. My mom sells the house and gives me less than 2 weeks notice to find a place to live. \n32. I want to move back into my home where all my things are. \n33. That created a huge family riff. \n34. I conceded and moved into a mold infested dump. I  had no furniture and had to once again start over. \n35. I was evicted because I found black mold in the apartment and brought it to my landlords attention. \n36. I had to scramble and find a place to live. A studio apartment. \n37. I move from there to a 2 bedroom. \n38. My grown daughter needs help- she\u2019s a single mom, I get a townhouse for us to live together in to help her. \n39. She trashed it. Wouldn\u2019t pay rent or help with the bills. When the lease was up my rent went up $400\/month. I had to find a new place to live and it wasn\u2019t working with my daughter. \n40. I move into a nice rental house\n41. I loose my job from COVID\n42. I find a remote job luckily. \n43. Finally feeling like I\u2019m crawling out of the dark hole. \n44. My ex starts a custody battle to take custody away from my daughter. \n45. $25,000 again in legal fees. \n46. Reunited with a friend from architecture school I had known for 30 years. \n47. We date for 2 years. Decide to take the next step in our relationship. We  move to his location - I take my remote job with me. \n48. We marry\n49. It\u2019s been a mental battle of depression and anxiety \n50. He tells me frequently \u201cthis isn\u2019t going to work. We need to figure something out and go our separate ways. \n51. The house is in his name. He bought it before we were married. \n52. Leaving again: I have nothing to start over with. \n53. I started a new job that increased my salary by 65%. I hate it. It\u2019s extremely stressful with intense deadlines.\n\nSo from 49 to 53 is where I am now. \n\nI\u2019m done. This life has SUCKED! \n\nI have nothing. No retirement. I live with an emotionally abusive husband. I\u2019m on eggshells every day. His sons act like shits to me and my daughter now 13. \n\n54. \nThat\u2019s my life\u2019s legacy.\n\nEdit:\nI forgot to add that in 2016 I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia. \n\nThe most painful nerve disorder there is. It causes excruciating facial pain that can be triggered by a breeze on your face, brushing your teeth, washing your face, talking , eating, anything that touches any part of your face that nerve touches. I\u2019m on several meds to keep it under control. For the most part it\u2019s livable with medication but it\u2019s always there. \n\nFrom the web:\nTrigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition.\n\nIt's called the \"Suicide Disease\" because it causes unbearable pain in the face and temples. It's often triggered by everyday things like brushing teeth, shaving, or putting on makeup. In many cases, the culprit is an out-of-place blood vessel that.\n\nYeah. \n\nAdd that in to all of the above.\n\nI. Hate. My. Life.",

    "Title":"it will be long, I'm sorry",
    "Content":"hi, so...there's a situation. before I'll start - english is not my first language, so sorry if my sentences sounds weird or aren't correct grammatically. \n\nso. for many years now i think that I'm depressed, but there are things that make me feel like I'm imagining things or something, i don't even know. because i feel things that depressed people feel - i have no strength to do basic things, i struggle to even brush my teeth and i need to prepare myself for taking a stupid shower. i just don't have strength and motivation to do anything. i have huge problems with my sleep and i can't eat normally. not because I'm trying to starve myself, i just literally don't have strength for eating and sometimes i even forget about it until I suddenly feel weak. and if i actually want to eat something, i have problems to pick anything because i have no appetite, so at the end i still eat little, but i guess that it doesn't matter since i don't want to actually starve myself and when I'm REALLY hungry then i can force myself to eat even stupid cereals. \n\nmy condition in general is terrible and I'm tired by everything I'm doing, even 8 hours in work is twice harder than it should be. and when I'm finishing something that basic like cleaning the house, then I'm very proud of myself and i feel like i just did a great work. I'm also very often thinking about basic depression things like 'is there a point?' or 'I am useless and pathetic, why I am even here if i am a failure in everything?' and other things like that. I also have a lot of emotional rollercoasters and I can start crying suddenly without any reason at all, and when I have the reason then I can't control my emotions and I'm starting crying even in public and humiliating myself in the process (I'm an adult, so I should control my emotions in public, that's so embarrassing). I also have a lot of issues about my self-worth and one day I think that maybe I'm not that bad when i managed to do something good and I even look nice, but then next day I think that I'm absolutely worthless, useless and ugly. \n\nI didn't mention a lot of things, but in general - I'm a wreck, yeah. but the point of this post if not to whine and complaining, and I'm sorry if I did it unintentionally, I'm just trying to explain everything the best i can. the point is, that I don't have one huge part of depression - I am not suicidal. actually quite opposite, I have a really big and serious phobia of death, I can have a panic attack even just because I started to think that one day I will die and disappear, that everything will not just go dark and I'll wake up later, but that I will literally disappear and I won't even be able to hear my thoughts or have another life, that I will just stop existing. even while writing these few stupid words I have tears in my eyes and I started breathing heavier. and I also appreciate a lot of things in life, and while I hate a lot of dumb and awful people and how cruel this word is, I see and love a lot of things that good humans made or beautiful things that nature made. and I am literally paranoid about everything that can take my life. and everything can take our life, so my life is a one big paranoia, a lot of small phobias is connected to this one big phobia. I'm afraid of a LOT of things and everything is stressing me, and even making me think about stupid scenarios like \"what if i would just have a car crash?\" or \"what if someone would just want to kidnap me or hurt me?\"\n\nI'm trying to function in a society since I have to, but I'm stressed about everything, even basic things like driving a car or walking alone by the street (I'm a woman so i actually have reasons to be afraid of walking alone, so it doesn't help my paranoia). of course, I'm doing all of this, I'm not sitting all days locked in my room just because life stressing me out and is exhausting. I'm trying to live, I'm trying really hard and I'm constantly crossing my comfort zone, almost everyday. even if everything is a huge effort for me, like every single thing, I'm still fighting everyday to just live and not ruin my life more than it's ruined already. \n\nand I'm really confused is what I have is depression or if I'm just pathetic or something, I don't know how to even describe that, i don't know how to think about myself. I had a therapy once, I was...surprise, who would have thought...scared, to go to a therapy since it could take my money without a reason (if that wouldn't help) and on top of that, my father was mocking me about even needing therapy. but I tried, so I had a therapy for a whole year. and yes, it didn't help. I think that maybe I found a not really good therapist, but I tried to trust her since she was all the time really nice and seemed like she wanted to help. but when I talked to her about my depression, she said that I can't have depression since I told her before about many things I appreciate in life, that I'm determined to live and that I'm full of excitement about my passions, and that she don't see it in me. I thought that - well, okay, she's a specialist in her job, I am not, so maybe i am just utterly pathetic and that there's no help for me. I literally don't know what's wrong with me. \n\nI recently started to think that I also probably have adhd on top of all that, since from what I read in the internet (not just few articles, i read a lot about that, mostly about real experiences from people that actually have diagnosed adhd) everything seems to suits me, and everything i read abouts experiences of people with adhd i think \"oh, yeah, that's me!\" and \"oh, that explains a lot, yeah, that's also me!\". unfortunately when i was during therapy i didn't suspended adhd yet i didn't tried to be diagnosed with it. yet. i was more focused on what's wrong with me and i wanted to have anything that would make me feel like i know what's going on. but eh, all months of therapy was almost useless. like yeah, it was nice to talk about my problems with someone who can tell me more than \"I'm sorry to hear that\", but it didn't actually helped me in anything. and i didn't even received any diagnoses, which was the main thing i wanted when i came there. i resigned after a year and now i don't have any therapy even if I'm aware that I should. i don't have great work and I'm not rich, i prefer to spend every salary on more important things like food, tickets on train since i don't have my job in the same city i live in, and all other basic needs or things that makes me happy and I'm passionate about, since it helps me to have at least a bit of joy when i feel like sh*t (idk if i can swear here so I'll censor). i just can't afford a therapy, and yeah, i know, maybe if i would try harder, started putting aside part of my salary, stopped buying some less important things like these about my passions...then probably I could afford a therapy. but. I'm reluctant to even try, since it didn't work last time, and happened exactly what i was scared about - i spend my money without a reason, I didn't felt like anything changed and even after a year I felt like everything is the same and that wasting my money on that was pointless.\n\nand honestly i don't think that it will have sense even in the future. like, I know that I'm struggling and my life is sh*t, that I'm a failure and all that, but there's no point. I don't think that my phobia of death will be healed, even if I would try. that's something that just won't go away and it will be with me until my last moment, because that's something that I won't escape. there's a lot of phobias, like darkness or bugs, and healing them is possible, because that's something we can work on. but death? how I can work on that? I can't. that's something that will happen and this paranoia about that will be with me always. I know that the only one thing I can do about that is accept it, and embrace something that is just as natural as being born. but the point of this phobia is that I literally can't. maybe in the future? I still hope that my life will be better someday, and I hope that if it will happen, then my phobia will be less destructive. since maybe I finally will be happy one day, and in that case, maybe my phobia even if still being there, will be just a part of me that will make me helpless and scared sometimes, but not causing panic attacks. but for now, it's strong and a bit ruining my life. I mean, there's a lot of things that's ruining my life. but I just have the impression that this one phobia is a main thing and every other phobias are just a result of this one phobia. \n\nand besides any phobias, if I have adhd and depression, that's another things that's making my life a lot harder than it's already and if i really have adhd then that's also a thing that was making my life harder since i was a kid. because yes, I was struggling even as a little dumb kid, always being hyperactive, having problems with concentration, and struggling for every one year of my whole education since I always had a lot of problems with learning and I needed to try harder than other kids to understand basic things in school. and I always needed more creative and stimulating ways to understand things better and to be actually interested in them. and I won't even talk about how terrible is my memory and how much I was upset at myself that I just can't remember things and that I need to spend so much time on learning stuff, and that even if I actually knew something, it often just disappeared from my mind in the moment I looked at the test. just great that no one suspended that maybe I have adhd and that no one decided to make my life easier and check if maybe I'm not just stupid. because like...I think a lot of awful things about myself, and maybe NOW I am stupid, but I clearly remember that as a kid I was reading a lot of books and when I was actually passionate about some subjects and when I was learning things in a more creative and stimulating ways, then I was able to learn a lot of interesting things and actually remember them. I remember how passionate I was as a little kid about cosmos, planets, stars and stuff like that. I was reading a lot of science books about that and even my parents was buying me science books about cosmos and stars on my birthdays apart of some dolls. but well, then somehow I went to school and barely passed a math test after learing a whole week for this sh*t. what a stupid kid, hmm, interesting if maybe something is wrong. nah, probably just stupid kid.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nthe point of this post was just to explain my situation and ask you guys if you think that I have depression since I'm not suicidal. but typically, I went off topic probably about 100 times throughout this entire post and started complaining about my life or telling things no one asked to read about, when I tried to write as neutral as I can and just give you information to get your opinion. so...sorry about that!

    "Title":"Feeling empty and losing interest in everything",
    "Content":"Edit: I feel that I should have put somewhere in the title of the post that I'm open to talking about it. I have seen that there are posts that have titles that make it seem like it's a very closed topic, like the poster has already made up their mind about how they feel. I felt like my post kind of does the same, so I guess I'd like to say that I'm listening. \n\n22 year old male.\n\nConditions I got:\n\n1. Narcolepsy and cataplexy\n2. Adhd\n3. High functioning autism \n4. General anxiety disorder (probably result of all my other issues)\n5. Depression \n\nSo I've been depressed since I was three. Runs in the family. Had a tough childhood cuz I had a lot of weird stuff that I nor my parents understood so I ended up being a big problem child. I struggled to make real connections in middle school and high school. I had friends, but I never really had them over or felt connected to them in an intimate way, very detached from life. I'd go to school come back, play video games, rinse and repeat for the enteriety of my general education. I also didn't date people because of anxiety, and even would go into denial about having a crush on anyone. Always told myself that I would start dating in college. So, graduated and went to college. I did make friends, but I had no social life to speak of. I wanted a normal college experience. Hanging out, study groups, going out,  maybe go to some parties (I don't drink and parties are really loud so it's not like I always have fun at them), and dating or even just being sexually active. I have a strong desire to try and live life in an experience rich way, but my anxiety and depression gets in the way of that. The friends I did make weren't super social either, so it's not like they were going with me to places. As for dating, I suffered extreme anxiety with women. I'd freeze up when I tried to talk someone I found attractive with the intent being to ask them out. However, I'm not so far gone in that I can't talk to women at all, even if their attractive. I have female friends that I made and I worked with girls in my classes, and I also met girls through extracurriculars. When it's a situation where I feel like I have a valid reason to talk to girls, or anyone really, I don't have a problem. I also struggled with finding purpose and feeling fulfilled in what I was doing as a college student. Eventually junior year came and I realized that I hadn't really changed he ways I wanted to. My college life was slipping by and I was once more trying to ignore my depression. When I realized this I broke. I couldn't do school anymore, didn't care about my major. I got cleared for a medical withdrawal and withdrew from college. \n\n1 year later and now I'm here writing this. I've spent the year going to therapy and trying to find meds that might help me, but nothing seems to work. I'm at the point now where I feel empty and that I've lost interest in everything. I always feel alone and unloved even though there are friends and family who love me. My parents are very supportive and care about me a lot, I know it but I can't feel it. I know my friends also care about me. I have issues being vulnerable and I have a avoidance attachment style, so the closer people get the further I push them away. I'm guarded against everyone, including myself. I want to cry but I can't, for some reason I can't let myself. It feels like I'm silently screaming all the time. I feel like I have no one to confide in. All my friends have lives, things that they're worried about and are focused on. It's not like they want to babysit me and poor time and effort in being emotionally interested in me in a deep way. I don't expect them to either. That's not a fair position or expectation to have on your friends. And even then, because I'm close with them, I'm not sure I could open myself to them, especially because it's awkward for me because my closest friends are also guys. I know I'm touch starved. It's been years since I've had physical contact with someone for more than 10 seconds. And I'm a still living breathing human who wants to be able to have sex and experience physical and emotional intimacy with the opposite sex. I still haven't found anything that motivates me and gives me fulfillment. At this point I want a purpose in life that I can throw myself into. I want to be obsessed with it and forget everything else, I want a reason to feel alive. \n\nI dont know what to do anymore. I become more and more apathetic, and I feel like I'm untethered and unwanted in my life.\n\nSorry about the length of the post. I just wanted to get everything off my chess.",

    "Content":"**FYI this is my first every reddit post so it might not be well written. the question is at the end so feel free to skip or skim read the context as it will likely be useless**\n\n**for some context on me and my life:**\u00a0\n\nI am 19yo, 6'3, muscular skinny build, male\n\nI am incredibly fortunate in every single way. I am gifted with academics getting straight A\\*s in high school and going to a very prestigious university to study electronics and electrical engineering(something I am passionate about),\u00a0\n\n\\- I work as a model for big brands walking runway shows in London and Paris fashion week,\u00a0\n\n\\- two weeks ago I competed in a world championships for my country.\n\n\\- I've completed a lot of side quests including: running a marathon bare foot for charity, building \u00a0 hydroponics and other robotics, winning county chess tournaments and the list goes on\n\n***these last two I'm by no means proud of or would ever brag about but are worth referencing.***\n\n\\- I am\u00a0 born into a very wealthy family with a very well known and respected name.\n\n\\- I get every girl I am attracted to although I am very unsatisfied with my dating life and most interactions result in fleeting hookups and withdrawn emotional connection as I get bored pretty fast.\n\n\n\n**the parts of my life that I keep in the darkness, although** I don't believe **that this is the cause of my issues** I **am interest to find out if you (the reader) thinks this may come into play with my issues**\n\nI had a difficult ish upbringing, at age **8** being I had a pretty bad experience walking in on my dad cheating on my mum whilst she was away and have never said a word about it. during covid at **16yo** I had one of the most challenging years of my life. my mother was in tears a lot due to the lockdown and private matters concerning her being lied about. my father left with another woman about a month into her depressing state and me and my brother had to look after mom (her crying became a couple times a day and we lived in the middle of no where so we had no escape). **within the next 12 months** my cousin went into a coma and passed away my child hood dog who had always been my rock passed from old age and my grandmother died from altzheimers (moms side). my first and only love had sex with my best friend that id introduced her too (this may need another post since I have a degenerate love life now) I was also receiving black mail threats from people online because of my father and didn't speak to him for 2-3 years. just as we (me, my mum and my brother) were starting to get home life back on track life was turned upside down **at 18 years old** I had graduated school with exemplary grades received a deferred offer (a gap year) from a great university when my mother had a seizure and was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer. One of the lowest points in my life was whilst my mom was recovering from one of her brain surgeries in hospital\u00a0 about a year ago my brother beat and strangled me because Id accused him of taking drugs. that night I just about escaped and stayed at a friends house who id told id been mugged nearby her place. this was also hardly spoken about.\n\n**she is still alive but has been given 4 months to live at the recent doctors report**\n\n  \n**through all of this I have continued to work hard and maintain my ambitions in life\u00a0and rarely let my emotions tamper with my life its worth mentioning that** I **rarely\/never outwardly express negative emotion about myself or life to others**\u00a0\n\nmore context on my psychology, I have pretty strong ADHD but I never take the medication. I feel at my best in super heavy workload and rigorous routine (that feeling of satisfaction at the end of the day). However I really struggle creating that routine\n\n  \n**My question to the readers!**\n\n**I feel like a bum and a loser despite everyone around me thinking I'm a super human**. I can't do normal things like clean my room, go to lectures and I even struggle getting out of bed in the morning some times. this makes me feel so incredibly shitty and I spend half my time sitting on my ass all day doing nothing. I am still on track for a first in university whilst maintaining international competing and modelling but I feel like im permanently spiralling out of control in my life. When ever I talk about the amazing things I am doing It feels like a facade and a lie despite it not being one.\u00a0\n\nI feel like I have been in a dark hole for a couple years now and really need to start looking after myself I typically struggle with maintaining a healthy eating and sleeping schedule (mine is degenerate I either hardly eat or eat a ton and the same pattern with sleep). I just can't do normal easy tasks in the day and it is causing me great mental pain\u00a0\n\n\n\n**I would love to hear about peoples advice and\/or own experiences with getting through any relatable adversity!**\n\n\u00a0**I just can't do normal easy tasks in the day and it is causing me great mental pain.**\n\n\u00a0**what have you done to get out of a dark place without damaging your ambitions or workload. also how do you build motivation to look after yourselves?**\u00a0",

Started even doing it in toilets at work and getting minis on my way there. Feel like my childhood trauma + falling in with friends who did drugs very early in life (about 13 yrs old) has made me the way I am and idk what to do. I don\u2019t want to ruin this for myself because this job is an incredible opportunity that I have been working to get for years but I\u2019m worried my using is going to fuck it up for me.

I\u2019ve been unofficially diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have always felt like there are way deeper issues which I have (likely due to growing up around alcoholics, multiple close family suicides\/attempts, witnessing parents physical and mental abuse as well as sometimes being the victim of it, seeing parents get arrested, restraining orders etc.) and it is very hard to get a diagnosis in Scotland. I have worked so hard through my struggles to get educated with pretty much 0 support, and now that I am on my way up it\u2019s like all this shit has hit me. I have always dabbled in drugs but never to this point, and I have been going on the way I am for a few months now. Likely it got caused by my dad\u2019s relapse about a year ago that really triggered those childhood feelings. Idk this is more a rant I guess but how do people get themselves together from something like this?? It\u2019s so hard and I will do well for a couple of days then get triggered by something minor and spiral",

    "Content":"I recently started on Vyvanse for ADHD. The Vyvanse was amazing - too amazing. As soon as I was prescribed I was playing with my dose, and while I was productive at first very few quickly I was taking it and just gaming and doomscrolling all day. \n\nAfter two months of always craving more despite trying varying doses I told my psychiatrist that it was making me crave more and feel like a junkie + seemed to be making my ADHD worse. \n\nWe decided to try methylphenidate which I\u2019ve been on for the past week and while I have never exceeded dosage guidelines, I have been increasing the dose fairly quickly and finding I only \u2018feel good\u2019 for maybe 2 hours and once again want more, like it\u2019s \u2019never enough\u2019. Methylphenidate in particular just makes me extremely anxious at higher doses so it\u2019s clearly not for me. I\u2019m going to have to tell her this isn\u2019t working either and try non-stimulant options. \n\nI just feel pretty defeated. I\u2019ve struggled with ADHD my whole life and only got diagnosed recently at 31. I also have an addictive personality and the flavour of my addiction changes like the seasons. It moves between gaming, to eating, to porn, to binge drinking (although just socially), to shopping, to nicotine, and recently it\u2019s felt like I\u2019ve been flirting a dangerous line with stimulants. I hoped that getting medicated would fix my struggles with addiction, not make them worse. \n\nWhen I read of other people\u2019s struggles with addiction 90% of the time either they just need to beat the physical dependence and they\u2019re good, or there\u2019s an underlying trauma or mental health issue which once they \u2018solve\u2019 they stop struggling. But for me it\u2019s just like I get addicted to anything that makes me feel good, and there never seems to be a point where I feel content with \u2018just a bit\u2019 of something good. Moderation of anything feels impossible and I was hoping medicating my ADHD would fix that. \n\nDoes anyone else here struggle with this? Were you able to find peace? I\u2019ve gone through months where I kick all my bad habits and exercise, meditate, and eat well, and I feel good but it\u2019s like I have to be laser focused on good habits or it all just goes to shit. \n\n\n",

    "Content":"Last May I had the unfortunate and upsetting news that my dad had died. The initial response was just total shock like it didn\u2019t even feel real what I was being told. My dad\u2019s side reframed a fair amount of the information regarding his death as they felt it would be too much for me, I managed to get the full story and found out that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and fell into a fishing lake and drowned in the middle of the night and his body wasn\u2019t discovered till the next following morning which I believe was Thursday morning when his body was discovered. \n\nNow before Dad\u2019s death I was brought up with a lot of drugs around me. When I was a teenager I had zero tolerance with drugs would never touch them or consider doing them. As I was enjoying my school activities and hobbies outside of school. I also understood the detrimental effects it has on that person and the people around them. Then when I went to college\/uni I started experimenting a bit as most people do at that age and I found it really fun made me confident, made me forget the things in my life that was causing me stress, anxiety, it almost was like a type of medicine but only gives you a short term fix on the problem. FYI I am referring to the Class A drug Cocaine. \n\nMoving into the start of my adult years and cocaine is still something I\u2019ve done on numerous occasions it starts off just once a month for big social event or celebration of some kind. Then before you know it that once a month has now jumped two times a month, then I start to think about it when i go to my local pub on a random Wednesday then all of sudden I\u2019m fancying a bag. The crazy thing is why would I give into these impulses as I\u2019ve literally seen what it did to my dad and the end result for him. But I still go ahead and do it. I\u2019m aware of all the warning signs I know when it becomes a problem when you\u2019re relying on substance I learnt that the hard way by having to look after an alcoholic all through my child hood. But I still decide to do it myself as well even tho I know full well how bad it can get. \n\nSince my dad\u2019s death my intake of cocaine has gone up. It\u2019s no longer for social events it\u2019s just me on my own taking it just because i want it. Or I will finish work on a random Tuesday and I will already have it in my head that I am going to get a G when I go home. It\u2019s not even social any more it\u2019s just me isolating myself and doing coke on my own. Now I don\u2019t know why the intake has gone up so much and maybe it is the grief of my dad\u2019s death and I didn\u2019t even notice I was taken more cocaine, maybe it\u2019s a coping mechanism. But it\u2019s gotten to a point now where i am starting to get worried as I feel like the codependency and the need for it is strong and I really don\u2019t want to go down the same rabbit hole my dad went down, cause at the end of the day it\u2019s death. \n\nWho ever got this far thank you for reading this. This is my first ever time putting something up on Reddit and of course It had to be something like this. I\u2019m not really sure how this works if people can comment or help in any way but I just wanted to write it all out basically. \n\nThank you. \n\n \n ",

    "Content":"Dear people, look, I really love my mom but I\u2019m so incredibly worried about her. \n\nTo give a little bit of background on where all this comes from, in august 2023 my mom had a seizure caused by an OD. She had a gastric bypass a year prior and got hooked on painkillers. \nAt the time of the seizure only my dad and I were home. I heard it but didn\u2019t think much of it because my little sister wasn\u2019t home for the weekend and I thought she was Joling around. That was until my dad kept repeating her name and she kept souding like she was choking. \nThat same exact thing happened 3 more times since then. \nMy mom started looking for help and currently is in a two-sessions-a-week-thing with a psycholigist at the local rehab. \nThe thing is, I was having suspicions about her still having meds for a while now, and heard a pill film crackling this morning, thought i was crazy, moved on. When I got out of the shower a few moments back I heard the same crackling and saw her standing by her closet. Suspicious but might as well just be crazy. \nWhen I was getting ready for bed tho like ten minutes ago I heard she was upstairs and heard the closet door again, with the same exact sound. When she went downstairs I went to check and sure enough, found half full strips in the pocket of a jacket. Took it downstairs, showde it to her and told her where I found it, didn\u2019t say anything more. I want to further confront her abt it but how the hell do i? For context I\u2019m 17, she\u2019s 46, dad\u2019s 47 and my sister is 14. My dad reanimated her the first time since we didn\u2019t know what was going on (he was freshly trained back then, licensed)",

I can't quit bc it makes all the pain from watching my wife's final moments, the memory is forever burned into my brain. She was my everything, and it was the worst night of my life forever. It makes me forget why I don't have my own house anymore, why I've been stuck at my parents for almost a year, why I didn't work for months or leave my house, until I got a job at my local vape shop one day when I was feeling better and had no success at landing any job. I was a former video editor and have worked for a few major companies. But it takes all I have to just pull my pants on and go to work, it does make me feel better and I love the job bc I'm injured from a car accident and currently getting medical help through a law firm, one of the reasons why I can't quit, super flexible and permanent hours with a super understanding boss, that's really hard to find nowadays. It sucks that I have users coming in to buy meth bowls or talking about hot railing if we don't, just them being there reminds me of how the rush feels. I started as an excuse that since I have ADHD and Adderall is not a potent but in the same family, so I would just use less and I would eat it or snort it to get that ADHD medication effect, that I've learned is a lie and always will be. Idk if Adderall really works with someone that has ADHD as severe as me it makes me focus and all that but not on stuff I need to, gives me energy, I have plenty of that, Klonopin slows my mind down, allows me to think and not talk over people, I do that on and off of ADHD meds or I'm a zombie that doesn't eat or socialize.

She left her problems here when she did, and made 1000 more for everyone else, especially me, to escape that's why.\n\nWhat do I feel like now? I can't stop scratching my beard and face, I have to stop myself from chewing on my lip and grinding my teeth. Sleep would be out the question without my Ambien (which I took about 20 min ago, current time 4:54am). Appetite, still almost non-existent I'm still forcing myself to eat and drink. I get in my car or room, basically anywhere I've used and I immediately take my phone out and turn on the flashlight and I gotta stop myself bc I'm looking for shards that aren't there. I feel like I wanna just rail a line or smoke a bowl to make these feelings stop. But I don't wanna chase the dragon anymore. I might be able to hide my habit now, but dependency is defiantly forming in some way.\n\nCurrent age 33 I feel the slippery slope of addiction and relapse. To start off I'll begin with the first time I did meth wasn't intentional age 20, idk if my friend knew or didn't all I know is he called me told me he had some girl and if I wanna bang out some gators, hell yeah its Friday. He gets there and we always were smart and would use a bump tool to test it, see how good it was, or if it was actually coke, he said \"house rules, the host gets the first bump\", at the time someone I felt as being a close friend this wasn't ominous foreshadowing, if he knew, well I could tell 100% the instant that powder hit my nose that was not coke, then nearly immediately I felt like I was going lightspeed and I could do anything, I also knew that it was meth the way it burned was like molten dragon piss in powder form or something. I guess being the \"good\" friend, I say it with quotes bc he became an addict immediately after so I'm not sure, he was he said something like \"fuck dude, I guess Imma ride it with ya\" Then it was 2 days of gacked the fuck out, I hated it bc all I could do after he left for the next 8 hours was lay in bed and try to jerk off with zero result(clarity I doubt it was 8 hours, but it was long enough I'll say that). I guess you're all wondering how'd he not know by looking at it that it wasn't coke, well it was 100% shake-and-bake all white powder and not enough light for me to really tell, I know bc at the time and a few years prior I would cook and sell with a friends dad, I knew this was a good way to make quick money, but I promised I never do it bc I saw how just an average, not tweaker meth head looked, and trust me a lot of average users in my state look a step up from a well known website and project that posts a lot of before and after photos. A few years went by(24-25) and one night hanging out with 2 longtime close friends, I arrive and a pookie soon comes out, I just say fuck it and try it they roll it for me and I got a good strong hit, felt like the last time I did it honestly, I think it was either trash meth or they weren't they best at rolling(I'll get to why I think that soon), chilled with them from probably 830pm to 5am, was able to goto bed just fine. Woke up no cravings nothing, good to go like the last time. Nothing and I mean absolutely no amphetamine or meth use, I was very much against it. Flash forward 8 years give or take, May 12, 2024 my wife committed suicide right in front of me, she did not die from her final act and I tried to save her but I knew there was too much damage, I agreed with the doctor that with her 10% brain function and constant seizures, and on life support, my wife was no longer with me I would never have her back in anyway, so after 3 days I said okay to them taking her off, she took her last breath 27 min later. First everything was what you'd expect from that kind of grief and PTSD, my parents pay for my therapy bc I knew I wouldn't be able to function without it. Its been working fairly well since my therapist has PTSD from being in Global War on Terror as a combat medic, she was one of the first women they allowed to go on major combat missions during major pushes during the 2nd invasion of Ramadi, she saw a lot. So she only treats vets and suicide survivors like myself through EDMR style therapy and I go to group every month. Everything has been getting better very slowly but far better than almost a year ago. I have always smoked weed everyday so that's not new and my consumption didn't increase. I drank a little for the first month to month and a half after her passing but that like all the other habits I've ever had I can just go nah not anymore and I'm done no cravings, withdraws, etc. Now were gonna go to late February of this year I for some reason met out of ALLLLLL the meth users that come into my store to buy \"oil burners\" chose one guy to ask if he had some shard or could get some, he didn't look like your typical tweaker that would come in there, he was normal looking, acted normal, but was def a more than occasional user, he said yes and gave me his number, when I got paid a day later my dumbass went and got a gram from him, while I was there we smoked a bowl and I finally felt \"the flash\", didn't realize it that was set it's hooks into me. But I didn't smoke, I thought I could get away with snorting it and eating it in small amounts for a short time to fix my sleep, I absolutely did not do that. A week goes by of not doing any of that, get paid call him again to try again, smoked and then snorted the rest, no issues with eating or sleep but did not fix sleep schedule. Another week maybe week and a half go by and I call him again this time I did it bc I wanted some, mistake #1, I buy it and a bowl and smoke with him and while I'm going about my day but I still keep it minimal and I'm really shit about rolling a bowl so I burn it most of the time and decide to go back to snorting just more at a time. Few days go by and now I buy it to repeat the high, I spent the day with him fishing and smoking meth and bought 3 grams this time. I smoked all 3 grams in 5 days, I would account the first half a gram as wasted bc I burnt the shit out of it, then I turned to trusty reddit on how to properly smoke meth, well I sure as hell figured it out now and I was rolling almost perfect every time. And I smoked and I smoked during the 5 days I slept twice for about 10 hours total and ate 3 out of the 5 days and I did and always do stayed hydrated. Only this time when I ran out, it wasn't like the last 4 times where I just got sleepy and went to bed, I went into tweaker mode, carpet shard goblin and all. And about halfway though the day of this I'm finally like wtf are you doing? STOP NOW. Thank god for being prescribed an SSRI and Klonopin bc It's been 24 hours, I had a full day of sleep(10 hours) I ate 3 meals, been hydrating and I'm still having a hard time, still gritting my teeth, still craving finding myself when I go look for something I'll catch myself \"shard hunting\" for a second and I'm like dude fucking cut it out. Problem is this guy is a regular, and even though he'll be more than understanding about why I can't hang out with him anymore, I can't quit my job its not an option, but I can't stop the meth users coming in there to get bowls all the time or dude coming in to get cigs every other day. I have to keep this job and stay clean. Please give me advice on what to do and ways to mentally fortify myself, I don't want that crap about \"just stay strong\" or \"just say no\"...duh, I wanna know what would you do as an ex user or addict in my shoes to prevent this, that's gonna give me a better idea on what to do. I know I can just I need your comments to be memories I can pull from to relate to bc it will give me strength. Thanks for reading,",

As in, if I want a drink because it makes me feel comfortable - accept being uncomfortable in that moment. Just because it\u2019s uncomfortable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible. We are stronger than we think. Mind over matter. I hope this helps one other person today. ",

    "Content":"Hi everyone, if you happen to come across my post I am sorry for the lengthy letter. I have been using meth for about 3 years. I work a full time job and still have a job thankfully. I rent my home and have three amazing dogs that I love dearly. I go to therapy weekly and I have managed to stay up above water this long. I have had moments where I wanted to quit and I had moments that question myself if it is even worth it. I know in the long run it will get me in trouble and I will or possibly can lose everything. I last used this evening and I am already just disgusted about it and about myself. I don't usually go out like I use to when I was younger but I don't think my addiction is the cause of wanting to be home a lot..who knows..but  does it really get better getting sober? I am literally wanting to just break my pipe and be done with it. I do notice though I am constantly thinking a lot, worrying a lot about stupid shit, and just the feeling of scared all the time. I know I am not 100% myself, but when I am high I don't care about anything just the great feeling it gives me the energy and everything. Tonight I am really considering just breaking my pipe and being done with it for good. I wanna be happy and I feel happy whenever I use but once I am about low and done I get sad cause I need to reup again....I don't know I am all over the place with this...please tell me the honest truth....or i'm I just thinking wrong that being sober is boring. I always tend to make excuses to meet up with people as well if I get invited out...its horrible....I already feel guilty I spent these years using...I want to stop...but only if it gets better...",

    "Content":"I'm very psychologically addicted to dexamphetamine due to my deppresion and really bad life situation, dexamphetamine isn't known to be physically addictive but it sure does have real bad psychological withdrawals for me, I wake up every morning and I have to take a pill because I know it will make the pain go away, this fact is what makes it so extremely addictive for me, just one pill and most of the pain is gone, I'm of course not prescribed these pills, I abuse them, they are genuine real dexamphetamine, they are 30mg per pill so as you could imainge they are pretty damm strong if you have no tolerance, but the withdrawals are so bad that they feel like physical withdrawals, I woke up today and when I thought about if I should take a pill, I went into complete withdrawal, my entire body went completely restless, my mind was racing and I was even shaking a little bit, so I took another one, since these withdrawals are psychological, I'm assuming that there can be methods to greatly help it or even stop it all together, the obvious answer is to get exercise and improve my mental health but I still need other methods during my mental health recovery because it's gonna take a while to improve.

I know it will help me advance my career and help me find my passion, but I know if I don\u2019t quit- I\u2019m going to ruin my chances to complete the degree because I\u2019ll be too busy getting high to care about the work.  I feel like I\u2019ve come to a sense of urgency to quit. Right now there\u2019s nothing holding me back from using except my own drive to do so. I\u2019m scared that my will to quit won\u2019t be enough. The last time I quit (for like 8 months) it was because I needed to pass hair screening- so I committed. Once I passed the screening I started up again. Since then I\u2019ve only been able to quit for like 3 months before going back to it. \n\nFuck. \n\nI need to try harder. I need to try be the person I want to be. I want to be stronger than this- I want to be free from these awful thoughts and paranoia.

    "Title":"A Letter to My Drug Addicted Mother",
    "Content":"Hello everyone. I hope all is well. My names Josie Kelley. I wrote my mom a letter after I had blocked her, and sent it by mail. She never ended up reading it. I want someone to see my heart. I know people in this community struggle with addiction. I know they struggle with many things. My heart goes out to all of you. Even if no one reads this, I want to put my heart on a platter from the daughters perspective of addiction. What I wrote below, it's what I desperately wished my mom knew when she thought I hated her.\n\nMama,\n\nI know it\u2019s weird to send a letter like this when we live in a day and age where phones and cars exist. I know I\u2019ve made it hard for you to get in contact with me in those ways, but I needed to get my feelings out. Lately, and probably a lot of my life, it\u2019s been hard for us to communicate with each other. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re the only girls, or that we\u2019re so alike, or maybe it\u2019s just simply how life goes for two people who feel things so deeply. I hope you\u2019ll read my full letter and its entirety. I had to type it out because I have a lot in my heart that I wish I could tell you. I have a lot of things that I want to get off of my chest. Please take the time to read it. I want to start off by telling you how much I love you, mama. I love you so much that sometimes I stay up at night and cry thinking that one day I\u2019ll never see you again. I\u2019ll cry thinking about how I haven\u2019t seen you and that I miss you. I miss you so much. I don\u2019t think I could put into words how I feel about you, mama. Out of every person on this Earth, I love you the most. I feel so complete when I\u2019m with you. To me, you\u2019re my safe place, you\u2019re my home. You make me so happy, like a warm childish feeling. I could go without everything in the world if that meant I could be with you. I know I could handle losing some people, but I can\u2019t handle losing you. I don\u2019t ever stay up praying for someone like I stay up to pray about you. I don\u2019t ever miss anyone but you. I don\u2019t ever cry over being away from anyone but you. You mean so much to me, I don\u2019t know how anyone could live without you.\n\nDespite what you might think, I tell everyone how amazing my mama is, and how wonderfully she raised me. When I moved out, I cried myself to sleep every night because I wanted to be at home with you. I know that may sound conflicting to you because I\u2019m the one that decided to leave, but I couldn\u2019t stay there anymore. I wish that things were a bit more simple. I wish things were a lot more black and white between us. Between everyone in our family. Out of every person, I feel a connection to you that I can\u2019t even begin to explain. I love my mama. I love you so much. I feel in my heart that you\u2019re the most special woman in the world. You\u2019re the most kind, the most funny, the most caring, the most beautiful, the most warm, and the most amazing person ever to exist. Despite how you may think I feel towards you, in my heart of hearts, you have all of me. You truly are the one who taught me how to love and to be loved. You did everything you could for me. You are everything to me. I love you with all of my soul that it hurts to think you aren\u2019t here with me like you used to be. I wish we still had our family together. I think about you all the time. I know you think I talk badly of you, but if there's one thing I can say, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want anyone thinking wrongly of you. When you do something, I know I can understand it. I know I can see what you were trying to do. Even though I can\u2019t show you that, that\u2019s how I feel in my heart. It\u2019s so hard for me to show you any vulnerability or sympathy. It\u2019s so hard for me to give you the comfort you need when you\u2019re sad. It\u2019s so hard for me to tell you that I know what you\u2019re going through. I know I can feel your struggle, I don\u2019t want anyone to get the wrong impression of you no matter what you\u2019ve done. They don\u2019t know you like I know you, why would I tell them anything that you did? Why would I bad mouth you? You hold so much of my heart Mom. I want our family to love each other. I don\u2019t tell all of the drama to Justin like you think, or vice versa. We rarely speak about family.\n\nHow could I tell people who don\u2019t understand you anything negative about you? You\u2019re wonderful. You\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re truly the apple of my eye, mama. You are the best thing to ever happen to me. Why would I want someone else to think you weren\u2019t precious? I don\u2019t tell anyone anything. I don\u2019t go out of my way to ruin things for you. I don\u2019t go off and tell everyone the drama. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than you. I could never be the woman that you are or go through the things that you have. You are so strong. You are so thoughtful and willing to help others. You are very selfless. Why would I think I\u2019m better than you? I know you feel like I think that, but it\u2019s just not true. I look up to you in many ways, I know that you\u2019re trying your best to keep everything together and I know that you\u2019re the only one doing that. I would never think I\u2019m better than you. You\u2019re living a hard life. You\u2019re doing very emotionally draining things. How could I think I\u2019m better than you when you do something so rigorous? You\u2019re a strong woman. A beautiful woman. You are a prize to be treasured. There\u2019s no such thing as someone better than you. You have to believe me for a moment when I say that. There's not a part of me that looks down on you, or Dad, or Colbie in the sense that I believe I\u2019m better. I think a lot of times, the two of us get lost in translation. We go off of what we believe the situation is rather than what it truly is. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m more righteous than you. I wish I could do more for you. I wish I could help you and make you happier. I wish I could be someone you could rely on more. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you that comfort. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve turned you away so many times. I\u2019m sorry for all the times that I\u2019ve been ungrateful. I\u2019m sorry for being so rude to you and being so mean to you, mama. I\u2019m sorry for not appreciating you more or making you feel like you weren\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m sorry for not giving you a shoulder to cry on or giving you the comfort you needed. I\u2019m sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to hold you when you needed it. I\u2019m sorry for hurting your feelings intentionally and all the many times I did it unintentionally. You deserved a tender heart from me, but I was blind a lot of times to my words or to how you felt. I was blinded by my own pain and anger. I\u2019m sorry for any time I\u2019ve lied to you, any time that I\u2019ve made you feel unhappy, any time that I made you feel like I was looking down on you. I\u2019m sorry for anything I\u2019ve done to come against you or hurt you. I\u2019m so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019m sorry, mama.\n\nI want you to be happy. I wish I could have been a lot better in the times where I wasn\u2019t good enough. I want nothing but the best for you. I wish that I could take all of your pain away and I wish that I could press a button and have all of our issues wiped away, I wish our family could go back to normal. In this letter, I may say some things that you don\u2019t agree with, but please, for me, please just read what I have to say. Please. I know things in our lives have taken a turn for the worse and it\u2019s like a rollercoaster continuing to push forward in the wrong direction. Our family fell apart so quickly that it was hard to stop it. In reality, when I think about it, it\u2019s all in slow motion. The slow grinding down of every one. I know that our family has struggled with many things, and I know that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it all. I come to you earnestly mom, I just want you to be honest with me. I just want you to give me some closure and something real. I need that from you Mom. Please. Please allow me this. I know. I know about a lot of things. I know and I don\u2019t know. I know there are things that I\u2019ll never know. You need to be honest with yourself. I know. I\u2019m not trying to judge you, Mom. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you. I just want my mama back so badly. I know you think it\u2019s fine and I know you think things aren\u2019t caused by what you\u2019re doing. But they have been for a long time. This letter isn\u2019t about Dad, but I know he's done more than his fair share of it too. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m just blaming you mama, but you don\u2019t understand what I feel for you. I don\u2019t feel the same things with Dad. I know it feels like I always let him off the hook or am being nicer to him, but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t expect him to do anything else. I expect so much from you because I know what you\u2019re capable of.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t understand it myself. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so much easier to talk to Dad, or why it feels like I can forgive him so easily when I know deep down he\u2019s nothing compared to you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Dad to pieces, but you... You were my mom and my dad for so much of my life. You were always there for me and raised me in the most loving, gentle, and warmest way possible. You did it perfectly, mama. I\u2019m so proud of you. You held me when I cried, you rubbed my feet when they hurt, and you kissed my knees when I fell. You stayed with me. You loved me, you nursed me back to health when I was sick, you made me laugh when I was sad, you played games with me when I was bored. How could anyone be a better mother than you? You\u2019re my person. It\u2019s so much harder for me to forgive you. It\u2019s so much harder for me to speak to you freely. It\u2019s so hard for me because I just want to express to you how much I love you but I can\u2019t help but hold things against you. I can\u2019t help but be mad at you. I\u2019m sorry about that. Something different about him, he\u2019ll be honest with me, even if it\u2019s just a little. He\u2019ll apologize because he knows he\u2019s an addict. An alcoholic. You\u2019re so much more than these drugs, mama. Then those people who are claiming to have your back. Dad is more than the alcohol and addiction too. But you're something special mama. You\u2019re so special. You\u2019re like diamonds and gold, how can anyone be better than you? You\u2019re more than all of this. You\u2019re my world. I can\u2019t help but hold everything against you because I want my mommy so badly. I want the mother who had that soft heart. I want the mother who wasn\u2019t weighed down by the world. I want you. I want you back. I know that these drugs talk for you a lot of the time. I know it feels like you\u2019re in a car with no breaks. I know things are happening so naturally around you that it\u2019s hard to think that these drugs are the issue. I know that mama. I don\u2019t blame you for being addicted. I don\u2019t blame you for hustling. I don\u2019t blame you for living the life that you feel was dealt to you. I don\u2019t blame you for those things, and I don\u2019t hold them against you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re disgusting. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re worthless. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re unsavable. You\u2019re more than any drug in this world, any lifestyle in this world. I don\u2019t blame you for those things. I blame you for not facing those facts though. I blame you for not being honest with yourself and with me. I blame you for not having the dignity to realize that you\u2019re not hiding the truth from anyone. You hurt others more by simply pretending you aren\u2019t doing what you are. If you aren\u2019t ashamed to do it in secret, you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to do it openly. I know. It\u2019s not hard to tell. I can tell when you\u2019re high. I can tell when you\u2019re sober. I can\u2019t tell every time you lie, but I know you do. Please just be honest with me. Please show me that. Please, mama.\n\nI have suffered a lot in my childhood, but I know many people have. I have gone through a lot of pain in my life, but I know many people have. I know that things and life aren\u2019t always normal. I wish you could be honest with me. If you would give me that, it would be so much easier for me to forgive you and have us move on. We don\u2019t have to live like this forever. Our family doesn\u2019t have to suffer forever. It starts with being honest. You need help. There's nothing wrong with that. I just want things to change and move on from this, I want to grow our lives and be together again. I want to come over to the house and feel welcomed again. I want to see you and feel loved again. I want to hold you and feel like a kid again. I want to show you my heart and not feel scared that you\u2019ll get high again. I want you to leave the drugs behind. I want you to be able to start a new life that you can actually be happy in. I want you back. I want these drugs to die and go to hell.\n\nI know that when I moved out, you had a lot of thoughts about it. I know you thought someone was influencing me. The truth of that is Mom, I\u2019m hardly swayed by others. Every time I confront you or try to talk to you about things that have happened, you always act like its other people who tell me what to say, but that\u2019s simply not true. I have never been moved to say something I don\u2019t believe. I have never been moved to hate you. People don\u2019t talk about you as much as you think they do. When I would come over here to Nana's house before I moved out, none of us would speak on you or whatever situation was going on. We moved out to get away from all of that. I have always driven my own ship. I have always formed my own opinions. Nothing I have ever said to you was brought out by someone else. Justin never talks badly of you, in fact, he only talks about how much he loves you and wishes you would get the help you need. Same for Nana. We defend you more than most people do. It\u2019s not fair for you to blame us in that way. When everything happened after the 4th of July, it wasn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s choice but my own to leave. I had warned you for months that I was going to move out if you and Dad didn\u2019t change, but nothing happened. You didn\u2019t believe me.\u00a0 I told you in December that things needed to change or I wasn\u2019t staying. The months went on. I tried to bring it up but nothing ever happened when I did. January, nothing. February, nothing. March, nothing. April, nothing. May, nothing. June, nothing. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Both you and Dad refused to get the help you needed. The help I begged you to get. I want you to be happy Mom. I want you and Dad to change for the better. I\u2019m sick of this life we seem to be stuck to. The last two years of our lives have felt like... honestly, hell. Alcohol, drugs, anger, violence, manipulation, and more have infested the structure of our family. I wanted change. I needed it. I begged for it. I tried to talk to you about it, I tried to warn you about it, but you would turn me away and get mad. You told me that I wasn\u2019t going to move out. I realized you told me that you wanted the same change as me just so I\u2019d shut up. You guys didn\u2019t even falter when I told you I would leave. You were shocked when I actually did and blamed everyone but yourselves. You and dad. You had six months.\n\nDo you think I wanted to move out mom? Do you think as a 17 year old that I wanted to pay my own bills? To burden the people around me to take me back and forth to work and school? To make all of my choices by myself? Do you think I wanted to be away from my home and my family? I was a child.. I forced myself to grow up and get somewhere that didn\u2019t feel like a house of darkness and depression. I\u2019ve done so much myself and I deserve some credit for that. I don\u2019t deserve you blaming me for leaving. I don\u2019t deserve you treating me like some spoiled brat. I don\u2019t deserve you treating me like I think I\u2019m better than you because I want more for myself. I didn\u2019t deserve how much you guys put on me. I\u2019m your daughter, not your emotional scapegoat. I\u2019m not the one that\u2019s supposed to bring happiness to the house and carry the burden of everyone's depression either. I don\u2019t deserve you belittling me. I handle EVERYTHING on my own. I do EVERYTHING on my own.\u00a0\n\nI tried my hardest to keep our relationship after I moved out. I\u2019m the one who came to see y'all, I\u2019m the one who called and texted y'all, I\u2019m the one who forgave y'all. You guys wouldn\u2019t let it go, you guys wouldn\u2019t treat me equally, you guys made me feel like an outsider. That wasn\u2019t fair to me. For the first month after moving out, it felt like I was mourning my family. It felt like I was mourning you. I cried and cried and cried. I laid in bed and sobbed myself to sleep every night because I didn\u2019t have my mom. I want you back mom. I don\u2019t want the drugs. I\u2019ve forgiven you time and time again, the least you could give me is a little respect and honesty. If you want to be honest with me, I\u2019ll always listen. I\u2019ll never judge what you\u2019ve done. If you lie to me again, I\u2019ll continue to push you away. Trust is earned in droplets and lost by buckets. You have lost my trust. I love you. If you want to get in contact with me after you\u2019ve read this entire letter, reach out through someone to let me know. If not, we\u2019ll continue no contact. I love you, mama. I love you so so so so so much. I love you. I miss you. I wish things could heal between us, but I can\u2019t be the only one healing it. I want you in my life. I need my mom. I need my dad. I need my parents while they're still around. I beg you mom. I beg and plead. I need you guys so badly. I just want to be with you guys. I just want yall to love on me and love me. Everyday it feels like I\u2019m mourning the person that I love the most. I want my mom back. I want my dad back. I just want you guys to be happy and healthy. I want you guys to get away from whatever is holding you back. I want only the best for yall. I love you. I pray to God to keep you safe and help you to be happy. Please read this letter earnestly. Bye mom.\n\n",

    "Title":"Seeking advice for parents",
    "Content":"I\u2019m reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for advice for my elderly parents ( Father: 64 age and Mother: 60 age, living in India) who are going through a very painful time at home. My father is doing business and my mother is housewife.\n\nMy brother has been struggling with addiction (codeine syrup and sleeping pills) for years. Despite two -three rehab attempts, he keeps relapsing. We\u2019re now planning to send him for long-term rehab (1\u20132 years), hoping this will help him recover. Also he has diabetes.\n\nWhat makes things even harder is my brother\u2019s wife. She regularly speaks disrespectfully to my parents, uses hurtful language, and shows no willingness to live peacefully. And yet, my parents have always treated her with kindness and respect. She lives Mon-Fri here and sat- Sun her parents house. My parents have even told her that if she feels unhappy in this life, she is free to make her own decisions\u2014even to consider a second marriage if it would bring her peace and a better future for herself and the child or also stay here peacefully, but she doesn\u2019t take any decisions maybe because of society shame. Even after speaking with her family, there\u2019s been no improvement, as they too fear societal judgment.\n\nThough both he and his wife work, they don\u2019t contribute to household expenses. My parents are homeowner and, despite age and health, still covers all the costs. My mother takes care of their child full-time.\n\nWe\u2019ve thought about legal steps, but we\u2019re held back by community gossip and inexperience with such matters. We\u2019re a simple family, and we\u2019ve never faced anything like this before. Right now, our main concern is the emotional health of our parents, also her.\n\nIf anyone has faced a similar situation or can offer guidance\u2014especially on how to emotionally and practically support elderly parents\u2014we would truly appreciate your insight. We\u2019re also open to hearing any legal advice that could help protect our parents\u2019 rights and bring peace to the home, while handling things as respectfully as possible.\n",

I'm back to working, seeing family\/friends, paying my bills on time with some money left over. I'm thankful to be where I am today. \nIf anyone thinks they cant get better, you will.\nI will admit, i am on methadone and have been the whole time I was using. I'm using the way it was intended now and going down 10mg every 3 weeks. Im at 60mg right now and was at 108 in July. I was scared to cut back, being sick is what kept me on the drug for so long. \nI was only getting from one person and he got locked up for a week, after 1 day i was already puking and tried from someone else. My anxiety is so bad, that one bag had me thinking i was about to die. I never wanted to OD and thankfully never did before. In that moment i decided im not doing any other bags until he comes outta jail. I stuck with my methadone for 2 days and craving a bag. Was cleaning my box so i could find straws to scrape and I find one brand new bag. Felt like i found $1000. I told myself this was it, watever craving i had this would have to fulfill it. I did it, felt good, and never touched another one since. \nFelt like i had the closure i needed too.\n",

Add the time i'm on my iPad and we're at about 7 hours. I've tried to set countless limits, my parents tried, too, but nothing seems to work. When my time runs out i just move to the next app, if that doesn't work out i move to my iPad. And I'm not trying to make myself less guilty of this addiction but I have very bad ADD and the dopamine and stimulation I get from scrolling or games or videos is making it even harder for me. It's so bad that I spend nights on my phone until 3 am and only get 3 hours of sleep. I feel so bad every single time I look at my screentime and I think of all the things I could've done instead of scrolling for hours on end.

I need advice on what to do or say for my roommate who is in a downward spiral. I really want to try and help him.\n\nKnew him in college and he was a heavy drinker. Multiple drunk and disorderly charges and hospital stomach pumps probably a couple times. \n\nFast forward to post college and he moves in with me and another guy. Year 1 great no real issues, clean and enjoyable to live with. Year 2 starts a job as a bartender and starts to drink multiple nights a week as well as stop caring about his room cleanliness. \n\nHe gets a dui and gets an ankle monitor that tests his sweat for alcohol. Sobers up for 2 months not by choice and is great. Clean again, nice to be around, doesn\u2019t just hide in his room. He gets the monitor off and says \u201cI\u2019ve never felt better I am going to really limit my drinking I know I need to\u201d\n\nHe does at first but working at a bar where the are allowed to drink he quickly is back his drinking escapades. Over the 6-8 months following the monitor being taken off, he hasn\u2019t done laundry (I know I should\u2019ve done something sooner), so he smells. Doesn\u2019t come out of his room other than to work at the bar.\n\nNow I find out he\u2019s definitely been doing coke at work and I come home after vacation and there\u2019s coke and rolled up dollars on the table in the basement. \n\nHis life consists of drinking coke and work. All of his coworkers do coke and I know that\u2019s where it started. \n\nHe has so much potential. He is so likable and smart and actually a really enjoyable funny person to be around. \n\nWhat do I do? Confront him? Bring his mom into it? Kick him out unless he changes? I really need help on this. Sorry for the long post. Please ask questions and I will answer what I can. \n\nThanks",

    "Content":"I hate this stuff so much. I had been on benzos on and off for 20 years, mainly Klonopin which was much easier to titrate off of.\n\nI was on Klonopin but got switched to Xanax over a year ago back when Klonopin manufactures were all on back orders. So my Dr switched me to Xanax 2mg 3x a day the same dose of Klonopin I was prescribed except I was only actually taking the Klonopin 2mg 2x a day. \n\nI just want to get off of this stuff so bad. I beat a heroin addiction that I had but this stuff to me is harder to kick than heroin. \n\nI have a refill on my Xanax next week and appointment next month. I\u2019ve been contemplating scheduling my appointment earlier before my refill to get it switched over to Klonopin again so I can start lowering my dose. In my experience Klonopin was always much easier to taper off of but this Xanax doesn\u2019t last long at all. I take it and read about all the negative stuff and a few hours laster take another 2mg pill to where it\u2019s up to 6-8mg a day now.\n\nI am scared because I don\u2019t have resources for rehab, I have a job, a life and everything is great but this medication is ruining everything. I want to schedule my appointment this week before my upcoming refill to ask my Dr to cancel it to switch it back to Klonopin instead of Xanax because I don\u2019t want to do another month of this and wait til my 3 month follow up with him.\n\nI get weird anxiety that in make it early right before my refill he is gonna cut me off which I know is illogical and just my anxiety because cutting some off of 6mg of Xanax a day is life threatening. I don\u2019t know if I should go in this week show him I\u2019m still taking them and have the remaining pills I should until my refill and so him to cancel it and switch it with Klonopin or just try and cope with it another month and go to my regular 3 month follow up.\n\nMy rebound anxiety in the morning is so bad sometimes I have to call off work. I had to call off today or sometimes I\u2019ll set my alarms for 6:45am to take my meds, then have my second one set for 7:30 so when I wake up I don\u2019t feel so awful. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, benzos should not be detoxed in an inpatient setting because it\u2019s a long monthly process \n ",

    "Title":"Advice Needed on Being a Supportive Partner to Someone with Addiction",
    "Content":"Hi, my (21F) partner (22M) just opened up to me about his struggle with substance abuse and overall dependency on marijuana, nicotine and pornography. He decided, on his own accord last week, to quit it all and is now going through withdrawal symptoms. But overall, he is seeking help from his family, actively finding a therapist and has opened up to everyone close to him in his life (his friends, his family and me). We did talk recently, and he confessed to me that he has been using nicotine and marijuana daily and has consumed pornography regularly as well. I was very proud of him for opening up and telling me the truth. I know it took a lot of courage to do so, and I reassured him I will be there to support his recovery every step of the way. We even made a plan where he will give me weekly check-ins on his feelings and any general urges he has.\n\nMy main problem is that I feel incredibly hurt still, and I feel major guilt for even feeling this way. We had talks in the past (maybe a little over a year ago?) where he told me he quit nicotine, and another where I mentioned his pornography use has influenced the way I perceive myself and my overall confidence in our relationship. Anyways, he did not quit when we initially talked about it. It hurts because it feels like this past year has been a lie. I can't help but think of all the times he would seem spaced out or high, and I just never noticed or passed it off as him being tired.  I may have also dropped the ball at times. I was too afraid to ask him, out of fear he would think I don't trust him. I don't know, I feel like I'm a bit out of my depth here. I want to help him, but I really don't know how without sorting through my emotions first, and I just don't know who to reach out to. I don't know anyone in my life who can help.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know his substance issues are a symptom of a much bigger problem; he is aware of this as well, which is why he is going to therapy asap. But I feel like for me to be the best supporting partner I could be, I need to address my own feelings about how his addiction has hurt me. Any advice?",

    "Content":"I'm not sure how to start this, but it's something I am grateful I finally found out when I hit rock bottom.\n\nI have been you. You've tried everything you can think of and you've failed. Night and day you fight with the demons inside you. You wrestle with your own brain and you wish you could win. But how can you outsmart yourself? How can you overpower your own brain? It knows what your plan is, where you're going, when you're tired and weak and unable to fight. And no matter how long you make it, how long you are good for, how long you fight\u2014it's never enough. Eventually, you will fail. And they will be right. You can't beat it, and you are a failure for it.\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you\u2014they're right. Tada! Turns out we are failures, and we can't get it right, and we will never be able to fix it. We suck at fixing it. And honestly, the feeling to give up trying isn't 100% wrong. But it is like 5% wrong.\n\nWhat it's missing is the fact that there *is* a way out. The little 5% gap where it is possible to change.\n\nNow the problem? That 5% is in different places for each person. But I can tell you where it's *not* at. That's pretty much the same for everyone:\n\n- It's not in praying harder.\n- It's not in hoping harder.\n- It's not in sheer willpower or strength.\n- It's not in distance from the problem.\n- It's not in new patterns of self-destruction.\n- And it's definitely not accepting your fate as an addict.\n\nI've tried all of those\u2014repeatedly, in different ways and flavors and combinations. They all lead to the same feelings of shame and fear and hurt and hopelessness and depression and anxiety and sadness and hate.\n\nNow, while that escape from addiction is going to be different for every person in every process, the fundamental power behind it will always be the same:\n\nYou have to quit lying.\n\n- Lying to yourself about being able to fix it.\n- Lying to others about how bad it is.\n- Lying about where you are and what you're doing.\n- Lying about the effects it has on you and the things you care about.\n\nThe worst shame of it all is being caught in these lies.\n\nI promise you\u2014*the lies about it hurt worse than the addiction itself.*\n\n---\n\nNow, I can't tell you where your path leads. I don't know your specific issues and circumstances. But I do know how I got out, and the general things that allowed me to do so.\n\nI hit rock bottom one day, and at 4 in the morning in a stranger's bathroom, I sent a text out to everybody that I had been lying to about my issue\u2014my now ex, my religious leader, and my therapist.\n\nI then spent the next month telling everybody that was connected to me and my addiction\u2014my parents, siblings, friends, roommates\u2014everybody I could think of that I had lied to. And let me tell you, that was the beginning of the end.\n\nSo far, I've been in an addiction recovery program for over a year. I have a stretch of sobriety, but honestly, that part doesn't even matter to me anymore. Sobriety days are just a number.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I find sobriety to be very important in my life, but it's not what I was working toward. I was working toward breaking free of the addiction. And I have. I am not tied down to the shame and the lies. I have nowhere left to hide\u2014and I love it. And it all came from leaving behind the lies.\n\nNow, I highly recommend therapy. I think it's the best way to go about reconstructing your life. But you have to go in willing to be broken down, ripped apart, rearranged, and then rebuilt.\n\nAnd if you can, join a support group. Find a group where you all have experienced somewhat of the same background and share. You\u2019ll all find that even if it's not the exact same experience, you can understand where the problems are coming from\u2014and why you're each struggling with them.\n\nBut if that's not for you, then find *somebody*. Just one person.\n\nSomeone you can tell *everything* to. Every excruciating detail. Every terrible thing you've done. Every hole you've found yourself in.\n\nYou have to get it out of you. You have to quit giving it the power to control you from the shadows.\n\nSo go get it done. You can't fix it, but you sure as hell can find somebody who can help you. Quit hiding, quit running, quit trying to lone-wolf it. Let yourself get ripped apart and fixed, and then you can go about your life how you wish it was.\n\n\u2014Just some guy on the internet\n\n",

    "Content":"There's something you don't want to look at.\n\nSomething ugly and uncomfortable that you aren't proud of.\n\nMaybe it's the way your relationship is going. Maybe it's drinking a bit too much. Maybe it's the hours you spend browsing YouTube and playing mobile games that just leave you feeling empty and like you've wasted your vitality afterward. Maybe it's that p\\*\\*n habit that's still not under control.\n\nRegardless of what it is, it's normal for your brain to feel resistance towards taking a deeper look at these uncomfortable, yucky situations you may be facing.\n\nBut where most guys go wrong is they let that resistance stop them.\n\nAnd interestingly, that pretty much guarantees that the yucky, uncomfortable bullshit will perpetually be a plague for them. Nothing significantly changing, certainly not for the better, often for years on end...\n\nOn the other hand, I've seen a certain type of guy.\n\nThey're the kinds of guys I love to work with 1-on-1, and they're also the kinds of guys who are actually my friends in the real world too. Guys who are willing to take a good look at themselves and\u00a0work\u00a0on any aspect of themselves that needs some attention, regardless of the discomfort it may make them feel.\n\nBecause they know a secret:\n\nThat if they feel a lot of resistance towards something\u00a0*that they objectively know would be good for them,*\u00a0then that's exactly where they\u00a0should\u00a0be looking, and they lean into that resistance.\n\nMaking themselves take a closer look, even if it hurts.\n\nSo I invite you to adopt that kind of mentality.\n\nIf there's something you've been avoiding because it feels yucky and uncomfortable and you wish it wasn't the way it is... well, the way to change it is to\u00a0own it\u00a0and\u00a0face it.\n\n\"If I ignore it for long enough it'll go away...\" is a loser's mentality that just flat out isn't true, especially in the case of relationship disharmony and addictive tendencies.\n\nWhat a lot of guys don't realize, either, is that their p\\*\\*n habit is sneakily connected to every one of the other most common things guys struggle with.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nMany men struggle to stay consistent in their disciplines - and if their brain's dopamine reward center is burned out from pornography, that's not surprising, because consistency relies on a healthy dopamine reward center that's functioning as it should.\n\nMany men struggle with connection in their relationships - and p\\*\\*n trains them to satisfy their own needs without a real partner being involved, undercutting their partners and their potential partners with a pixel-harem that'll do anything they want at the tap of a finger.\n\nMany men struggle with anxiety - and p\\*\\*n is something that fundamentally fractures their self-esteem and confidence, causing that anxiety to spike after they indulge.\n\nMany men struggle with spending\u00a0way\u00a0too much time on technology - and that's a form of escapism that's reinforced by using p\\*\\*n, too. If your brain's reward center is desensitized to the normal pleasures of life, because it's used to the \"super-high\" stimulation of p\\*\\*n, it basically won't want to engage with those \"normal\" aspects of your lifestyle as much, preferring the screen or the booze or the whatever that give it quick, easy dopamine and escapism.\n\nWhich is why quitting p\\*\\*n is one of the cornerstone steps in the modern man's self-improvement journey.\n\nBecause leaving that self-destructive habit in place negatively influences all the other areas that are worth giving a shyt about.\n\nAnd removing it, conversely, helps uplift those areas.",

    "Title":"Seeking advice for partners Alcoholism",
    "Content":"I apologize if this is vague, I don't want to disclose too much information that would identify anyone.  \n  \nHello, for about 7 weeks i have been seeing a lovely woman. This is the first time i dated someone drinking so much (1-2 x 750ml bottles of wine a day). Personally, I'm a casual drinker, i rarely have more than 2 drinks, and probably around 6-8 on on average week. Personally I've gone 4+ years without drinking with no real issues, so alcoholism is not something i can relate to personally, but its something I've watched many friends go through, and luckily those that have usually sort it out.\n\nWe have had open discussions about her drinking, and I've always felt we are on the same page, she is accepting she drinks to much and needs to stop, and has discussed quitting and rehab. the idea of her going to rehab, or working to fix her drinking issues are both things i am 100% behind, and exited for.\n\nthe part that's killing me, is that this \"rehab\" (supposedly going to be out patient program) is being initiated and paid for by my partners best friends family. which is apparently connected to her also leaving the city we live in, to move across the country and live with her friend, who has also recently gone sober and is 6 months clean.\n\nHer friend is essentially saying i shouldn't talk to her or expect to hear from her, and its confusing to me because i don't know if I'm supposed to move on, because i want to be there to support her and increase her chances of success.\n\nI'm all for my partner getting help\n\nI'm all for my partner moving to another city, if that's what they want.\n\nWhat I'm not all for, is my partner being pulled\/pushed into this situation by her friend which allows her to afford to do it.\n\nBeing that alcohol isn't an issue for me, I'm also happy to stop drinking to help my partner.\n\nI'm totally fine with giving her as much space and time she needs to get better, im just worried that her friend is trying to address the issue without looking at and addressing the root cause of her issues, family trauma.\n\nRegardless of what happens, i will respect my partners decision, and support her through it, even if that support means letting go. \n\nSurely our friends mean the best for us, but what they think or choose is not always the best in the end. my intuition leads me to believe that her friend is more attached to my partner than me, and that her \"help\" has self interest involved. recently sober girl wants her old drinking buddy back to be sober with her, and because my partner is unable to get the assistance for sobriety with out her friends family, it's a \"don't bite the hand that feeds you\" situation.\n\nI did a lot of reading on here weeks back just looking for advice on how i should best deal with it and that taught me that shaming her or guilting her for drinking is generally not helpful, and i understand she needs to want to fix the issue or have it started negatively impacting her life for her, i know she will need to make some bigger adjustments to her lifestyle than just going to rehab, because once shes out, its a long process to learn living without alcohol.\n\nSorry for the rant, thanks for reading. any\/all advice appreciated\n\nI should add, my brother is also an alcoholic, but much worse, and has been to in-patient rehab, which didn't work for him. So not to be a skeptic, but i have just seen what i waste rehab can be when someone isn't ready for it.\n\n",

    "Title":"I realized, through my Dharma Recovery meeting, that the pinnacle of my addiction issues is I\u2019m addicted to external validation.",
    "Content":"So, I\u2019m someone who has bipolar and extreme PTSD. Like, there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019m 100% completely estranged from the entirety of my family levels of extreme PTSD. \n\nI went to a Dharma Recovery meeting for the first time yesterday and then yoga through The Phoenix afterwards. I learned so much about myself and it\u2019s been the most helpful recovery group I\u2019ve ever been to (and I\u2019ve tried them all\u2014AA, NA, SMART Recovery, etc). If trauma is a main trigger for addiction issues, I really highly recommend Dharma Recovery. Anyways, because I stopped overthinking through the meditation practices and just let the thoughts flow through my head naturally, I realized a few things. First of all, while I went back to recovery groups for my DOC of cannabis and to make sure I stay off of the alcohol and meth I used to abuse, the core of my addiction is external validation. Why? As I put it in my meeting yesterday, in my childhood as a 3 year old, if I didn\u2019t notice the slightest twitch of one of my parent\u2019s eyes to see how they were doing, I had to worry if I was going to be alive in the next 5 minutes. So, I theorize I developed an addiction to external validation because it was the thing that kept me safe at that time. Second, after I realized this, I realized that I do not need external validation anymore to feel safe since, 95% of the time, I\u2019m safe now because my family will never see me or hurt me again. My new mantra is \u201cyou don\u2019t need external validation to be safe\u201d and it\u2019s so helpful. Third, when I did yoga afterwards, I told myself that I\u2019m safe enough to let go of the physical tension in my body. A headache released in my head and I realized that I\u2019ve had a headache 24\/7 and didn\u2019t realize it because it was just normal to me. \n\nIn my last 11 days of sobriety, I\u2019ve learned one very important thing. To be sober, you need to be 100% honest, stop escaping your reality, and accept it no matter how painful it is if you want to be sober. And, I realized that because external validation is truly the core of my addiction, I examined some of the friendships I had started re-introducing into my life. Then it hit me. I constantly feel extreme emotional pain 24\/7 because, with how nuanced my life has been truly, people are just unable to understand my life. And, because I\u2019ve been so traumatized to the point where trauma infects every conversation I have (minus small talk), I try to talk about things that are personally important to me (say, my struggles with bipolar or if people ask me how I discovered I was transgender) and I get invalidated every time. Because the core of my addiction is external validation, I feel so extremely hurt in every personal relationship I\u2019ve ever had and the dynamic becomes extremely co-dependent every time. I also figured out why I keep attracting terrible people into my life. They must see that I was craving external validation. Point is, I realized that because of this addiction, having close, personal friendships are a very bad idea for me and I just want to be alone in that regard. Humans need social interaction, so I will socialize at my Dharma Recovery meetings, events my local AA club has, different clubs at my university, etc. However, I\u2019m done talking to those people outside of when I go to engage in those communities (like, I\u2019m not texting people outside of when I see them at a Dharma Recovery meeting for example). So, I explained this to the connections I had been reintroducing in my life. All of them got either pretty sad or angry, but I don\u2019t care. It protects me and honestly, it protects them too. \n\nIt was very difficult to accept at first, I won\u2019t even lie. But, now that I\u2019ve accepted it, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulder. I\u2019m actually thinking things through more logically. I\u2019m much more confident in a healthy way in the world. Before, it felt impossible to prioritize my needs (even eating). Now, I have zero issues eating. It sucks I\u2019ll never have an emergency contact, but as an introvert, I\u2019m very happy to engage in my communities when I need my human need of socialization and then just be by myself at home playing video games or watching funny videos on YouTube. I\u2019m actually 100% comfortable being alone I found out. My two favorite things in the world right now is playing poker on my phone and doing yoga. I just had an addiction to external validation that was confusing me. \n\nI start intensive therapy for addiction recovery tomorrow that is 30 hours a week. Afterwards, I\u2019m just going to go to meetings and do homework where I can (I took a leave of absence from work despite not being able to afford it at all because I need to focus on recovery and my professors know that I\u2019m not really working on their courses till mid-May). I\u2019m actually happy I realized this before I started intensive therapy so I don\u2019t try to latch onto anyone who\u2019s struggling a lot like me when I go tomorrow. ",

    "Content":"I'm 20 so I'm over 18 and have the right to medical privacy. Thankfully no one contacted my family last night, that would've terrified them. I collapsed after doing quite a lot of (untested) ket and smoking weed. I'm a daily benzo addict and a poly addict (every day I use something that gets me high because the benzos don't but often swap between stuff. I've only done ketamine a few times before). I was talking to someone in my temporary accommodation at the time where I'm living because I'm homeless due to addiction, social services told my parents they had to kick me out after my addiction came out to them when I had a suicide attempt on illicit substances in my bedroom at my parents house. \n\nMy family haven't been bad with my addiction or anything but they worry a lot. I've scared them and I hate that, I hate worrying them. But I also try to be honest with them because they want me to be. So far I've only told a friend and sent my key worker at the addiction service a message saying what happened. \n\nLast night an ambulance was called. Initially I collapsed and I'm not sure if I went unconscious. Then my breathing got harder, I felt like all my chest and esophagus was tight and I couldn't breathe properly. I was twitchy and tense and I remember having spasms. All my muscles are sore today. The paramedic was squeezing my collarbone hard at one point and I wasn't even responding to or feeling the pain, he checked after that he hadn't broken it because he said he was squeezing it hard. I haven't seen the notes so I don't know everything and I wasn't properly conscious for a lot of it so I remember the basics but not much. I know they said they gave me narcan twice (nasal and then IV) but didn't suspect opiates because it didn't do much. Apparently I had respiratory arrest. I remember having oxygen and something about co2 at some point? Something on my neck too. And an IV with stuff put in it. That's pretty much all I can remember. \n\nI discharged myself against medical advice last night at hospital. They did vitals and an ECG and took blood but I wanted to go before they got the results, I just wanted to go to bed and hospitals are a trigger so I needed to leave. They let me sign a form to go after assessing my capacity and making sure I knew the risks (respiratory depression, etc.). \n\nI feel like crap today. Nauseous, weak, tired, sore, dizzy, I just feel like crap which is probably to be expected. I still don't know what went wrong anyway, if there was something else in the ket or I ODed but I didn't think you could easily OD on ket? But apparently I looked and was bad. I felt bad, I thought I was gonna die. I felt like I was dying, my whole body was prickly and tingly and then everything felt muffled and I thought I was gonna go. \n\nBut yeah I'm alive. And I don't know whether to tell my family anything. I haven't even told my best mate in case I scare him or he feels responsible because we did the same K together the night before though it was mine and I bought it and it was different then because I was careful and it was fun. Last night I was in a bad headspace trying to make it go away so I just used and used and kept snorting more. ",

That might indicate that he's running with nefarious people in the suburbs.  \n\nHis  life has been not so good; his father is manipulative SOB who calls CPS constantly on the mother who the kid lives with. They separated right before COVID and divorced later and the son lives with the mom although for a brief time he lived with father who then revealed to the kid how bad he was as a father. I don't know of any physical abuse but wouldn't rule it out.  The father is some piece of work and the mom has her own troubles in the mix but tries to do the right thing by him.\n\nCurrently, the kid seems to be talking to people who are not there and these voices are trying to convince him that his mother is a racist and other stuff. She is not a racists far as I know or in her sister's experience with her ( I'm their cousin )\n\nKid lives in a Long Island suburb of NYC, middle class and Caucasian, if that info helps in some way to define what drugs he might have access to. To me it seems like any kind of drug is available considering its near NYC. What kind of drug(s) might do this?  It might have been underlying dormant mental condition that was exasperated by the drug use.\n\nI'm really concerned for him. I was just down in Long Island visiting them two weeks ago and he seemed fairly normal playing with new born kittens, laughing at my jokes, conversing with adults and not out of it at all. Now he is suddenly out of touch with reality and this has never happened before this.\n\nI don't know if this is the right place to ask this or if there is anything useful I can gain by asking here. If not here what subreddit? \n\nThanks.",

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) withdrawal for some people can be nearly as bad as long term opiate withdrawal. \n\nI was a daily heroin addict for 5 years. I have used Benadryl as a sleep aid at different times in my life. Withdrawals from Benadryl can be nearly as bad as heroin withdrawal, including delirium and psychosis. I have had two friends who became psychotic and suicidal from it and had to be hospitalized. \n\nThe fact that people can walk into any shop and start taking it nightly without any warnings or doctor\u2019s oversight is a real shame. Most people have no idea what they\u2019re getting into and don\u2019t find out until it\u2019s too late.

I have a friend named Ashley who is currently dating another girl who we both know from rehab. The other girls name is L.  L was sober for maybe a week and is now on a complete rampage with crack. She told me she would come hang out with me one day and then spend the whole day smoking crack and having sex with my neighbor. She's just in a bad place right now. I'm not judging at all, we've all been there. But the thing is, A is in love with L........ fiercely. I have tried to warn her about the dangers of dating an addict that's not in recovery but she won't listen to me the last time we hung out we were all at a meeting and we are in the back of a van being driven home together (to our various homes)... I said,\"hey, a, can I talk to you about something real quick?\" And she said, \"is it about L?\"  And I said \"yeah but it's not something terrible I just wanted to talk to you about it.\"\n\nAnyway, she shut me down and she refused to talk to me about it. Today I followed up with her and asked her how she was doing and she kind of gave me the cold shoulder. I think she's upset with me but I was just trying to help a friend who was going down the road to hell. She is going to ruin her recovery if she keeps dating a crack addict who refuses to get help. Or more likely, says they are going to get help, but refuses to get any help.... Can I get some feedback or anything for me to think about the situation? I need to understand it more. I have a hard time with people pleasing and I feel like I did something wrong by wanting to warn her but I'm just trying to warn my friends so she doesn't go under. Please tell me to understand. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf38",

To give you some background on me, I'm a nurse practitioner (psychiatry is not my specialty) and I see people in nursing homes.  Most of my patients are 60+.  Recently we had a new admission who will be staying with us for a couple of months.  I recently learned that prior to coming to us she was using Fentanyl regularly, multiple times a day.  We talked about this and she told me that she's been to rehab multiple times, couldn't give me a number.  I specifically asked if she knew why it didn't work and she wasn't able to tell me.  I also asked her if there was anything I could do for her while she's with us to help and she said no.  The way I left it with her is that if there's anything I can do to help I'd like to here from her.\n\nWe can get her into rehab if that was something she wanted but it sounds to me that this is a moot point.  Getting her in to see a psychiatrist isn't something that we can easily do - just not a lot of options where we're located.\n\nI'm posting here to ask if anyone has any advice about what I could do for her.

    "Content":"Hi Guys, \n\nI am 26 Male, I work as Data scientist, I earn in 6 figures, being a Data Scientist is great, I love analyzing stuff. This is one of the main reasons I became a gambling addict. \n\nI though analyzing the patters and predicting according to the calculation will bring me big rewards and it did for some time. But as all things go I started loosing, at first it was small, like I would win 3 times and loose once, which is a great thing right. But that once became twice and I started loosing more than I earned. But then myaanalytic brain started to work and then started to invest big amount because I was certain even if I win once out of twice I will be getting profit because of the ratios. \n\nAs you guys may guess after certain period of time I started to loose soo much that I lost count of, this has been going on for 2 years, I don't even know how much I lost, I would run out of money at the month end and would borrow money from parents, friends to make ends meet that month, I would of course return next month as soon as I get my salary, only to my friends and not parents, yes I took advantage of that. Thinking back, I am disgusted on myself. \n\nEverything changed 6 months back, I got a bonus on my job (it was a big amount, almost 6 months of my salary), I never spoke about my bonus to my friends or my parents and yes I gambled with that money, I literally lost 6 months worth of my salary in just 1 week, yeah in 7 days. That was the deciding moment when I realized I was addicted to gambling. I logged out of all gambling sites and uninstalled all the apps. This was the first time in 2 years where I lost all my money in first week of the month. I made sure I would not place a single bet or even open those sites till end of month. I would not borrow money from my friends and just borrow enough from my parents that would last me till the end of the month. \n\n2nd week was really tough, I was fighting a battle within myself to not borrow money from friends and place bets. But I started to realize few things that changed, I was more happy and slept peacefully, I started to exercise more to distract my mind. At the end of the month it was almost 22 days, I never felt like gambling. The best thing that came out of this was me falling in love with sports again. I never felt like watching games as soon as I ran out of money, but here I was enjoying games without even thinking about placing bets. \n\nI confessed to my parents everything that happened and how I overcame it. My parents moved in with me for sometime to help me overcome it, they made me go to therapy which helped me a lot. They went back after I started making progress. Every month from then I send certain amount to my parents to invest in Mutual funds and other investments. \n\nNext few months I saved money, this helped me to join my friends on a luxurious New Year Eve party, where I met my current GF, she is an amazing person and I confessed about my previous addiction (you know in case I relapse) she was and still is very supportive and is helping me a lot to make sure I am completely out of this. \n\nSo yeah, those 21 days literally saved my life and made me meet probably the love of my life (well it's been only 3 months so). \n\nThanks a lot for reading my confession and trust me guys 21 days helps a lot. \n\nLet me know if anyone of you have gone through this and how you guys came out of addiction\n ",

She is funny, witty, caring, smart, empathetic, sensible and a movie buff like me. I know she is objectively good-looking\u2014though not like someone I used to admire before I met her. Despite that, I love her deeply. Our sex life has suffered, partly due to my low testosterone, varicocele, and weed usage. I regret how I\u2019ve let this affect us, and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty for being selfish.\n\n\nFamily: I love my wife and 18-month-old daughter deeply. I\u2019m aware of my selfish nature and want to change for them.\n\n\nAddiction: I\u2019ve been struggling with my addictions for years, and my wife is tired of hearing me complain. I need advice and encouragement to break free.\n\n\nWeakness: I\u2019m mentally weak and often give in to temptation. I used weed during my wife\u2019s pregnancy despite her requests not to, which led to a fight.\n\n\nPhone Usage: While not excessive, I believe reducing phone usage could improve my stagnant career and overall life.\n\n\nAttempts to Quit: I\u2019ve tried many times to quit these habits but failed each time.\n\n\nWork and Relationship Issues: I\u2019m laid-back by nature, and my wife feels I don\u2019t help enough at home, especially with a full-time job and a child. My low testosterone makes me tired, which is why I want to reduce phone addiction.\n\n\nCareer Depression: I don\u2019t love my job and feel depressed about it. I plan to stay for at least 10 more years to secure a good future for my family.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice or even just acknowledgment. I feel mentally weak, like the gambler in Dostoevsky\u2019s novel, struggling with these addictions.",

    "Title":"Anyone experience \"withdrawal dreams?\"",
    "Content":"For context, I was addicted to opioids for more than a decade. Hard-core, terrible addiction. Relapsed many times. I'm 2 years, 2 months, 1 week, and 1 day sober today. \n\nHere's my question: has anyone else experienced incredibly vivid dreams while going through withdrawals or going cold turkey? Like dreams that you still remember now that you're sober and kind of.. haunt you? I feel like this has to be a phenomenon others have experienced but I've never known who to ask about it, and didn't feel AA\/NA meetings were the place to get answers from a wider audience. \n\nI had these dreams several times when I either went cold turkey, or ran out of my DOC, or before \"coming to\" after a bad bout of withdrawal. Many times they were so vivid, I'd have a hard time after trying to discern if parts of these dreams had actually happened. And this part is hard to describe but... sometimes I think of these dreams in a really nostalgic way, almost like I miss living in that weird \"dream state\" after, where I was convinced some of these things had actually happened. I apologize if all this is nonsense, I guess I'm just hoping someone will say, \"I know exactly what you mean and feel the same way about my dr*g dreams.\" Because sometimes when I'm drifting off to sleep, it's comforting to think of these hyper-realistic things that never actually happened to me, but *feel* like they did.

    "Content":"I was up to three full weeks, then relapsed mentally and by the end of that following week, I was back on the crap. And once I get a supply, something in me refuses to stop until it's all gone, used. I can't even convince myself to flush it. I don't know where this \"I ain't a quitter\" bullshit came from in my head, but I can't shake it. I am out, again. Used way fucking more this time. What normally would've lasted two weeks only lasted four days. The last several times have been the same. My therapist and my case worker keep trying to help me with harm reduction, but I've come to realize that just don't work with me. If I have stuff, I'm gonna use it. And if I have money when my cravings get bad, I'm gonna get stuff. I don't even have my numbers saved, I just know the places to go.\n\nDid NA for a while. Got a bunch of numbers. Tried for the 90 in 90, but only got to 26 in 28. Every number I called or texted never responded back. Hell, I'd stick around after every meeting to try to talk to someone, but they were always too busy with their friends. I got two people to talk to me for a little bit. They still didn't respond to texts. And I never did find anyone willing to sponsor. Tried five different rooms. Idk. Maybe I have a weird vibe. Fuck if I know. My friends like me, my girlfriends like me. The people at NA, not so much. Lol.\n\nAnyway, I've been off shit for four days (as of today). After the last bit, I finally crashed out and slept for a day and a half. Still getting things back into a semblance of a schedule. And I got a lot of things coming up this week. My partners are gonna be here for a few days, and I got a wedding I'm going to this weekend. I got money coming, too. Not sure that's a good thing. I mean, yeah, gotta pay the bills. But there's always just enough left over to ruin my life a little more. I mean, I guess it's not like I got a lot of time left, anyway. My degenerative neurological disorder is eating away at what's left of my body, already. Least when I'm loaded, I don't feel the pain as much. \n\nJust thoughts, I guess. Sometimes it's nice to let them out.",

I hate myself for the harm I caused my child sometimes I feel she be better off without me. She almost 2 now \n\n\nEver since I lost all access to my child, all I\u2019ve wanted to do was die. I spent all week trying to OD on fentanyl, but it wouldn\u2019t work because of my tolerance. So I acquired other drugs, I figured a good mix of Methadone and benzos would take me out.

    "Content":"Been an addict for ten years and it stole my life away. Before I got into drugs at 17 I was a musician full of passion, drive, creativity, and excitement for my future. But drugs slowly took over everything. It was so fun and exciting to learn about them at first and be stupid with my friends but I became obsessed and then felt like I needed substances to be normal or around anyone socially. It started with cigarettes, alcohol, weed. Then I got into some pills from here and there, bars, psychs, GHB MDMA, all the main drugs people think of. Some I used with a lot of restraint, but other substances I full on abused. Alcohol, GHB, benzos, weed, and kratom the most. I used to be so productive and put all of myself into art, I even stupidly thought the drugs would help inspire my art, which psychs can for sure, but ultimately when you get dependent you spend all your time trying to maintenance the addiction and it makes it impossible to really dedicate yourself to anything. At least that\u2019s how it was for me because I have bpd and I was always running away from home scared to commit to anything and build a life for myself. I basically squandered all my potential and it\u2019s been to painful to bare what I\u2019ve done to my life because I loved where I was headed so much before this. I\u2019ve lost everything I loved. I\u2019ve sold so many of my instruments for drugs, distanced myself from my family, didn\u2019t dedicate myself the way I should have and fought so much with partners from being high and overly triggered with my inhibitions down. I romanticized and glamorized this addicted life of mine and every time I would try to get completely clean I would just feel so bored and miserable like sober life just isn\u2019t worth living. But I\u2019m finally tired. The latest addiction I\u2019ve had is kratom and it\u2019s literally killing my body. I\u2019m way underweight, my boobs are shriveling from hormonal imbalance, I\u2019ve gotten so many injuries from using it with other substances and hurting myself and the wounds not healing properly, I had utis almost everyday for six months straight, my skin looks sickly, I\u2019m aging faster, I just look strung out and tired all the time. I don\u2019t want to end my twenties off only living the same ground hogs day of living in my grandpa\u2019s house just making enough money ubering to buy more feel frees and vapes, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m not on any street drugs anymore, but kratom is honestly worse than all of them for me because it\u2019s affecting my body the worst and it\u2019s so accessible. I\u2019ve been resigning myself to this thinking I deserve to suffer like this, feeling sorry for myself. Waking up everyday feeling like I\u2019m going to have a stroke or pass out wondering how much I\u2019ve damaged myself. I\u2019m just at an all time low and I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of being poor, filthy, underfed, and unhappy. I want to finally reclaim myself and my life and stop acting like I\u2019m just a victim that\u2019s cursed to be addicted forever because I have mental health issues and hate the world. I want to finally get over not just my addictions but maybe even get my OCD treated so I can stop living in paralysis and be a person again. I\u2019ve been scared and felt like I had no resources but I do I just have to put a lot of work in to get to them but I have to start doing something about myself, for me. I don\u2019t want to let my body go anymore and I don\u2019t want to hate myself forever even if I have way too much trauma and am fixated on all the negative aspects on my life and the world, I just want to finally be a person again. I don\u2019t want to just live for some fantasy of male validation and drugs and sex and \u201cbeing a maverick\u201d anymore. I want to stop fighting people and just live my life for me and stop blaming others as an excuse to continue to use. I don\u2019t like 12 steps but I have to be able to find something that works for me. I just felt completely alone and defeated but there has to be people out there that will at least let me hold a space in the world even if I\u2019m not perfect or they don\u2019t like me. I deserve a life and I want to give myself one. ",

I missed out on many chances to meet people and feel connected.\n\nBy the age of 24, I had never been intimate with anyone.

I started using cocaine about 6 months ago with my significant other (who no longer uses and never did as much as me). At first, it was just every now and then when we were together. As of about 4 months ago, it became a daily thing for me. I usually consume 3g a day (insane, I know) & don\u2019t see myself quitting anytime soon. I just fear the repercussions of quitting, especially since I\u2019ll have to go through it alone. \n\nFor most, this addiction makes them a lower version of themselves (so I\u2019ve read), but I feel people have liked me more in the last few months (coworkers, family) than they ever have. I feel like I\u2019m a nicer person and much more enjoyable to be around. I don\u2019t fight as much with my family as I used to, and I don\u2019t get as down at work and nasty as I used to. \n\nI have noticed things about myself that other people have mentioned; my short term memory is spotty, I find myself looking for specific words when conversing way more often than I used to, etc. I just don\u2019t know what to do, and was looking for other people\u2019s stories\/experiences with quitting long term, high volume usage.\n\nIn advance, thank you to all who share, and to those who don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing, you\u2019re not alone and I hope this post helps you too. \n\n",

It started when a friend came to visit me in Denver and wanted to try cannabis. The devils lettuce wasn\u2019t legal where I grew up and I never had any desire to break the law so when my bud wanted to try it, I had a YOLO moment. I. Fucking. Loved it.  In the beginning I had the self control to only do it on the weekends, and slowly that self control dwindled and I began using daily. I found that it really helped me escape the stress of a horrible marriage and not really care about anything else. \n\nUnfortunately it turned into my main coping mechanism and it feels like I can\u2019t live without it anymore. My short term memory is shit and I\u2019ve been the epitome of \u201cout of sight out of mind\u201d my entire live and getting high only makes it worse. I can easily go through a 1g cart in a day. Nowadays, it doesn\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m \u201chigh\u201d other than the worsened short term memory, but I still feel the need to use. After finding out that I was cheated on, I filed for divorce so that\u2019s a big stress relief, but we had a kid together and my ex will be in my life until our kiddo is out of high school. \n\nI don\u2019t want to use anymore, and I know that ultimately this is something I want out of my life, but the biggest benefit I get from using is that I\u2019m able to be much more in touch with my emotions and can communicate them much more effectively. I find it very hard to part ways because I still see the benefits. I talk to a therapist once a week and see a psychiatrist and even between those two, I still struggle to stop. It feel like I\u2019m in a vicious cycle and I want out. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\n",

    "Content":"To start the story off, my husband has neuropathy in both feet and is under the age of 30. With that comes multiple surgeries multiple different times getting sepsis and so on and so forth. After those surgeries, you\u2019re given a hard-core drugs and you get dependent on them. My husband recently had a surgery and got sepsis in his big toe and has given up all hope. Ordered a whole bunch of drugs off the dark web to our house, and continue to do all of them in a span of three days. He has lost control of his bowels. He has lost most motor function and motor skills. All he does is take oxy and nod off. The other day he did more than 10 g of ketamine and I found him on the floor nonresponsive. I continued to call the ambulance and when I called all they did was pump his stomach and sent him home. Meanwhile, I\u2019m getting begged for more drugs and getting told that he needs drugs to survive almost to the point where he\u2019s crying. Six or seven months ago, he had a seizure and broke his shoulder and had to have a surgery on his shoulder. With that said last night, he told me that I should\u2019ve let him die from the seizure. He has told me more than once that he would like to die. No amount of support or his mom hiding things from him is enough. I\u2019m scared by my birthday in June that I will be a widow. \nThis drug use is very sudden, and I feel will be the end of his life. I, myself feel lost and alone. And I don\u2019t know what the next step could be as he does not choose to go to rehab, so we cannot force him. I need some sort of support group or something. I don\u2019t know what I can do. I\u2019m begging someone to respond. I need all the help we can get. I love my husband very much and watching his life get lost to this disease has broken my heart. ",

    "Content":"i had previously shared about how i think i\u2019m developing a cocaine addiction. one of the things i mentioned in the post was how i didn\u2019t want to stop because i felt like it made my life so much better in many aspects & how there were too many pros for me to really want to stop. i decided once the coke i had was gone i just wouldn\u2019t buy anymore but i only lasted one day without it. i\u2019ve been slowly getting larger amounts & it\u2019s getting really expensive. the first time i had bought a .7. yesterday i got 2 grams. the first week or so a line would make me feel really high for like an hour. even a bump & id be booted. i took a bump this morning before work & it felt like nothing. i took another i felt a little high & decided to leave it at that so i wasn\u2019t fucked up at work. the past maybe 4 days i\u2019ve been doing pretty fat rails & i\u2019ll do several in a row. before i would do pretty thin lines & one for each nostril like every 30 minutes. i told my closest friend G about my coke use to try & hold myself accountable to have someone watch out for me. i deeply regret this because it\u2019s starting to take a toll on our relationship. yesterday i saw G & accidentally left my weed at his house. today i saw him & when i was getting ready to leave i went to grab my baggie of za & it was empty. in front of everyone i accused G of smoking all my weed & he defended himself saying there wasn\u2019t that much but i insisted he smoked it all. i really didn\u2019t care that much that he smoked all my weed (which he didn\u2019t \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb) so i said bye to him like normal & didn\u2019t think anything of it. a little bit after i got home G facetimed me & explained that it wasn\u2019t nice of me to bring it up in front of everyone & that he really didn\u2019t smoke all my weed he just had a joint. he also mentioned that he knew i was still using but i quickly shut him down & said i didn\u2019t want to talk about it right now. i was about to cry i think he could tell so he said peace & love & hung up. i cried for a bit & maybe a couple minutes later he called me again. he said he loves me & cares about me & that we really need to talk about my substance abuse. i started crying right away & told him i didn\u2019t want to talk about this over the phone i wanted to talk in person. i\u2019m gonna go talk to him tomorrow. geez i feel terrible part of me wishes i never told him but this is good i think. i have people that really care about me that can help me through this. it\u2019s all so stupid all i have to do is just stop doing coke. i know i should but for whatever reason i just can\u2019t.",

    "Content":"A few years back I think 6 years ago I worked in sales. A high pressure environment. I was presured by my co workers to drink and take cocaine on our sales night outs aswell as on the sales floor. at the end of the week in a moment of being completelyshit faced after a rough week  i did a few keys with the guys. However unfortunately i have become quite addicted to wanting a bag or few whenever I start drinking. \n\nBut again this comes with conditions however If I'm with a certain group of people I want it if I'm with others I don't. The group I do it with don't force it on me and when I've asked them to hide or not ask me to be Involved however I always end up trying to get my hands on it even when they arnt participants themselves \n\nIs there any advice on how I could not want to do it. Or how I could possibly partake slightly maybe and not go over the top. \n\nI have already beaten the daily addiction of doing it every day on the sales floor but I'm still weak when it comes to drinking. On my own sometimes or with the that one particular group \n\n\nUPDATE: so someone asked but the comment has disappeared. Yes I worked in sales I specialised in gold silver and platinum coin sales everything from roman coinage to modern day sovereigns. For our non uk friends. British coinage was at one point made of gold. I basically sold these to investors not only on the gold value but the rarity of the coins. The company I worked for reworded us sales agents woth free alcohol weekly paid pub trips to boost morale etc etc. Out of the 32 members in my team 26 of them did cocaine. Managers directors and our hr staff did cocaine. I was coerced into trying cocaine after our summer bbq the temperature was hot I drank way to much alcohol and was completely drunk. My manager came to me and offered multiple times told me I'd be sorted if I did a bump. I did it and well it became quite a regular thing to do at first enjoyed it. Did it whilst on the sales floor with other agents and did well selling etc. However I noticed it became a problem for me when I made My younger sister cry to tried to pull a small prank something so trivial it shouldn't have bothered me but I went off the Rail. \n\nAs mentioned I have stopped using day to day and now when I drink which is only weekend. I crave it now if I stay with the friend group I made I crave but don't want to participate or get on it like I used to. However occasionally my old colleagues bump into me and I fall back into habbits.\n\nAny advice on how I could cut it out completely or a way to deal with the crave whilst drinking ",

    "Title":"What 40 Years of life Taught Me: Understanding the Mental, Physical, and Hormonal Triad of Balance",
    "Content":"I have spent years trying to find out what makes me tick, what thrills me, excites me, and how to prevent that excitement from turning into anxiety. Finding coping mechanisms for my ADHD and deal with anxiety and\u2014at times\u2014depression. Constantly changing mental states, motivation, energy levels, and other factors that keep throwing me off balance have been a really big challenge\u2014one that has led me to stay addicted to certain substances or habits for extended periods. There have been good times, where I managed to stay motivated and sober for months and even over a year and a half at one point, but relapses are always around the corner.\n\nOn my journey to finding that sacred equilibrium that leads to a life worth living, I\u2019ve come across so many bits of knowledge, and I\u2019ve assembled them into an eclectic (perhaps pseudo-scientific or non-scientific) belief\u2014one that helps me battle on and hopefully find my peace or a balanced form of chaos that makes my glass half full instead of half empty. I am absolutely not a scientist, but I have read a lot about the sciences of the topics I will discuss. There will be mistakes along the way, but I believe that my interpretation and main goal are a shot in the right direction. I hope I can offer those who read this a shortcut or a guide on how to manage their problems without having to go through the years and years of challenges I have gone through. That would make it worthwhile for me\u2014because then at least my misery will have served for something greater.\n\n# The Myth of the Silver Bullet\n\nI\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours reading, watching videos, listening to podcasts, all with their own one-stop-shop solutions to \u2018how to get your life back on track\u2019 or \u2018how to be successful\u2019. They often promise that if you do this one thing or make just a couple of these small changes, your life will change for sure. Dozens of commenters acknowledge how their lives actually changed and how the miracle lessons have miraculously healed them. The problem with these comments is, of course\u2014survivor bias. Even if there are thousands of comments stating their lives have changed, this is still a very small percentage if there are millions of views, and those were just the lucky few whose specific problem was addressed by this particular solution. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the majority of people will heal with this quick-fix, one-trick-pony remedy. Meanwhile, those who didn\u2019t solve their problems have already continued their journey in misery to find the next big thing that can potentially heal them\u2014and are too exhausted to leave negative feedback. This is not to say that the advice given on many of the topics in self-help media isn't helpful\u2014it usually is\u2014but there is rarely a singular solution to a comorbid problem.\n\n# Wounds You Can't Bandage\n\nIt\u2019s not easy dealing with mental problems because they involve much more of our ego than physical problems do\u2014at least for me. When your leg is broken and you cannot walk, you can learn to live with that; it can be remedied and it will likely heal. It can hurt, and maybe you broke your leg doing something stupid, but then you\u2019re already bringing the physical pain to a mental level. Physical problems can be challenging, but they can usually be dealt with in a practical way; however, mental problems are much harder to grasp. You cannot patch them up with a band-aid, you cannot supplement them or binge or gamble them away\u2014even though we try doing so a lot. Addictions are usually band-aids on mental wounds that require surgery instead.\n\nMental problems are tied to our ego, which makes them much harder to deal with, because if something is wrong with your body, there is either something you can do or nothing you can do at all. But with mental problems, there is a big sense of guilt; it\u2019s not your body that is flawed in that case, but it\u2019s you, as a person, your ego, everything that you are\u2014your entire existence, reasoning, and character\u2014it is all flawed, at least this is the perception. Have you ever noticed that almost every self-help podcast or video is about solving problems that require a physical action, like meditating, going to the gym, eating a certain way, or taking a supplement? There are barely any self-help guides telling you that you need to go get serious cognitive therapy\u2014because that\u2019s a problem they cannot help you with. There are a few so-called systems that tell you how you should deal with certain situations and apply some kind of abbreviation or initialism that will help you in those moments\u2014Three G\u2019s, 5 B's, twelve T\u2019s, whatever. They can help, but they won\u2019t stick, because they don\u2019t treat the problem; they don\u2019t even patch the wound like a supplement could; they simply distract you whenever you run into another wall.\n\nMental problems can sometimes be fixed by physical solutions, but in most cases\u2014when we have a history of chronic mental issues\u2014the problem cannot be treated by just a singular solution, but it requires a multilateral approach. So is therapy the solution then? Again, a singular solution that will not fix a multitude of problems. More on this later.\n\n# Chasing Physical Solutions\n\nI didn\u2019t like to accept that my problems stemmed from mental issues for a long time, so I have looked for dozens if not hundreds of ways to solve my problems physically. I\u2019ve tried supplements, excessive workout routines, a keto diet, losing weight, cutting alcohol\u2014and probably a whole lot more. Often, I initially thought I had finally found the solution and I started feeling better\u2014probably due to the placebo effect\u2014but after a while, I returned to my old miserable self and relapsed into whatever state I was in before my newfound miracle solution.\n\nSome things worked better than others; for instance, actually going to the gym 5 or 6 times a week helped a lot, but eventually, I had an injury\u2014and that ended my excessive gym period for the next year or so. What was also very confusing to me was that at times I felt worse when I was living my healthiest life as opposed to when I was an alcoholic and I felt fine mentally\u2014but physically I was in a terrible state. The mind has the ability to push your body past its limits and far beyond\u2014I\u2019ve experienced this during times when I was highly motivated and required barely any sleep for days, even weeks. Eventually, the lack of sleep and unhealthy lifestyle catches up and you pay the price. This is where the key to all of this comes in...\n\n# The Chemical Rollercoaster\n\nThere are a lot of hormones that make us who we are on a daily basis. Serotonin, Dopamine, Cortisol, Oxytocin, and Epinephrine are several main contributors to how we feel and act every day. We all know oxygen is important, and we can find out really quickly by holding our breath; you\u2019ll be reminded of how much we need it within just seconds. We also know very well what the importance of food is; try not eating for a while and we grow hungry. We all recognize these deficits very easily and very acutely, but with hormones it is very tricky\u2014they\u2019re not so easy to identify, and they blend into one big soup in your brain making you the person you are.\n\nA lack of dopamine can make you demotivated; a lack of adrenaline, lacking in energy; a lack of serotonin, depressed. Even though you are not aware of it\u2014like with food and oxygen\u2014your behaviour changes when your hormones are not at the levels your brain likes them to be. So if your dopamine and adrenaline (epinephrine) levels are low, you are more likely to engage in risky behaviour\u2014like gambling or extreme sports\u2014that will give you a quick rush and reward you with the sweet dopamine and adrenaline hormones your brain craves. Your mind is more intuitive than you might think. There have been reports of children putting metal objects into their mouth because they had iron deficiencies and no one was aware of it; their brain just signaled them to lick that shiny metal object because their iron was running low. Things may seem random at times, but most of the time they are not random at all\u2014that sudden craving my daughter had for yoghurt, while she rarely ate it. Turns out she was running low on protein because she doesn\u2019t like meat.\n\nThere is a problem with short-term rewards that induce much-needed dopamine, epinephrine, or other deficit hormones. They cause spikes and crashes and in turn set you up for a lifetime of roller-coaster hormone management. Then there is downregulation and upregulation of hormones. When you spike a hormone for an extended period of time, your brain will down- or upregulate them, making you more or less sensitive to them. This means that if you start gambling, at first a small bet will give you the required amount of hormones you are seeking, but over time, you will need more of it\u2014and it needs to get more extreme, too\u2014because you are becoming insensitive to that specific hormone. This is your brain\u2019s way to deal with a flood of hormones. Last but not least, for those of us with ADHD or other neurodivergent disorders, the brain is running low or is insensitive to certain hormones by default\u2014making us want them more than the neurotypical person\u2014and that is a reason why so many people with ADHD are sensitive to addiction.\n\nIf you want to get your life on track, you will need to balance your hormones and even more so, you need to do it in a healthy and sustainable way. You will need to replace the bad habits with healthy ones, perhaps take medication and supplements. But as mentioned before, physical solutions are not a solution to a comorbid problem; even if you manage to get your hormones stable and steady, you have to guide yourself through a mental minefield to not relapse and create a hormonal tsunami. Your hormones right now control how you feel, but managing your hormones will control how you will feel tomorrow. Hence it\u2019s important not to go for short-term gains, but to build upon long-term rewards\u2014rewards that will help you feel good all the time. The big trap I have found here is that eventually it\u2019s your deep-rooted mental problems that can throw things off balance again.\n\n# Foundational Pillars (But Not the Whole House)\n\nKeeping hormones in check involves a lot of physical action. Three pillars of a balanced life are sleep, nutrition, and exercise. These three will get you a long way towards living a better life. Get enough sleep, avoid refined sugar (short-chain carbohydrates), and exercise 2-3 times a week. This is something that is commonly agreed on to be a good way to live.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re mentally in a bad place and your hormones are all over the place, it seems much harder to keep these pillars up. But if you want a chance and you have to start somewhere\u2014start there. Perhaps you need some medication or supplements, perhaps you need to meditate or take an ice bath\u2014these are things you will need to figure out for yourself and maybe then, you can get a handle on things. But eventually, you will need to confront the demons inside your head\u2014the patterns that always bring you back to where you were. Having a healthy lifestyle alone does not guarantee feeling good even when all the hormones are at optimal levels. Your self-sabotaging ego will eventually bring you back to the state prior to your newfound equilibrium.\n\n# Fueling the Brain: The Gut-Brain Connection\n\nYes, I know this sounds like every health podcaster out there, but hear me out: the gut-brain axis is extremely important. A healthy gut means a healthy brain, and if you do want to get those hormones in check, eating the right things cannot be underestimated. It also means that you don\u2019t have to rely on supplements most of the time. But if you really want to eat healthy, this has to become another thing to dive into\u2014because modern Western society has a grievously terrible food industry that does not care about human health at all.\n\nMy no-brainer advice on food is simple: don\u2019t eat refined sugars\u2014none at all. All other things like salt, fat, meat, dairy, etc., are a much too complicated and nuanced topic to devote to in this writing. Food has the single biggest impact on our health and hormones on a daily basis\u2014and it should not be underestimated. When I was on a keto diet, my day-to-day life changed completely, and I still look back with envy of that time. But the keto diet is very hard to maintain and lacks much-needed scientific research\u2014especially for long-term health benefits or risks. For mental stability, however, keto is surging as treatment that might be used in ADHD therapy. It helped me wake up energized in the morning, kept my energy levels consistent, and reduced my ADHD symptoms, but eventually\u2014I got very depressed and decided to take a break. I am not sure keto was the cause of it; it could have also been winter depression or a dozen other things. But once I started eating carbs, my depression instantly disappeared. The mistake I might have made here is that I linked not eating carbs to getting depressed, but having gone for a couple of months without carbs and then eating them again can very well create a ginormous short-term hormonal tsunami of pleasure\u2014because the brain loves carbs and I just handed it its favourite quick-fix fuel source. After a week or two back on carbs, I stopped noticing the positive effects and went back to being depressed\u2014and that is when I relapsed into alcohol and then gambling. It is a slippery slope; one domino falls and they all fall.\n\nDo not underestimate how much food can influence behaviour\u2014especially at a young age. There are hundreds of thousands of kids that are being misdiagnosed with ADHD simply due to having a very bad diet at home and in school, filled with processed foods and non-complex carbohydrates, which\u2014especially for a developing brain and body that is already abundant in energy\u2014can supercharge them, making them go hyperactive.\n\n# The Comfort of Chaos: Confronting Self-Sabotage\n\nI\u2019ve felt great mentally while treating my body like garbage, and I\u2019ve felt terrible living as healthy as I can\u2014in complete abstinence from any addiction. The problem is not just hormones, not just living healthy or unhealthy, but a combination of things. Living a relatively calm life is confusing for me. Having ADHD, living a balanced life means I probably run a deficit on dopamine\u2014and keeping myself from getting what the brain needs sets me up for failure eventually.\n\nBut that is not all. The biggest problem might actually be the fact that the brain tries to stick to what it knows\u2014it likes to live in a recognizable pattern and it fears the unknown. Being miserable and living a chaotic lifestyle means I\u2019ve gotten used to it; my brain has actually grown accustomed to being in a state of misery and it likes to stay there. So whenever things are going well and I am actually gearing up for success, the brakes are pulled and I start self-sabotaging hard. I might overdo my exercises in the gym\u2014subconsciously creating injury; I might relapse into a binge-gambling session even though there was absolutely no need for it\u2014and I even had all my hormones at the perfect levels. My self-sabotaging nature is the final frontier, preventing me from finally getting to the goal I have been chasing all my life\u2014something I have managed to touch several times but was never able to hold on to: being genuinely happy and even more so accepting that happiness.\n\nYou can live as healthy as you can, you can have the perfect balance, you can manage to swap out your bad habits for healthy ones, your short-term rewards for long-term rewards, you can eat, sleep, and exercise all you want\u2014and still manage to ruin it all. And that is why it\u2019s not a proper lifestyle or perfect hormonal health that will get you your life back, but serious cognitive therapy\u2014possibly with the right medication, and optimally with all the aforementioned pillars of stability.\n\n# Mind Over Matter\n\nThere were people living in terrible physical conditions in concentration camps during WWII; they managed to push themselves beyond what is deemed physically possible. Most gave up or were simply pushed beyond what the human body can sustain\u2014but only those who were mentally able to overcome the insurmountable obstacles were able to survive the physical pain. And these prisoners, I can assure you, did not have their hormones at optimal levels\u2014not at all. It\u2019s the mind that carries the body, not the other way around.\n\nHowever, the triad of the cognitive mind, the physical body, and the hormonal balance determine if you are going to achieve happiness and balance or not\u2014with the cognitive mind running the show. Keep in mind, without a healthy body or with hormones out of control, it is inevitable that eventually you will succumb to trouble; it will just take a bit longer, because the body can tolerate a lot\u2014but the ego is much more fragile.\n\n# What now?\n\nFocus on your mental health\u2014make it your biggest priority. Your surroundings matter; the people around you can either lift you up or bring you down. Your gambling or drinking buddies may not be the best people for you to hang around with. Maybe you need to cut the rope and end your abusive relationship. We often stay in relationships because getting out of them means drastic change and a lot of unknowns\u2014but staying in toxic environments will keep us constantly self-sabotaging.\n\nPersonally, I think I self-sabotaged in my previous relationship because I had to somehow justify my abusive ex\u2019s behaviour\u2014and if I gambled away my money, I could put myself on the same level as her. She did bad things, but hey, I gambled, so I was just as bad. There was no way I could allow myself to be in an abusive relationship if I had to acknowledge that I was a good guy myself.\n\nMany gamblers acknowledge that gambling is not about money, and I believe that\u2019s true\u2014even more so, gambling can be a symptom. Maybe you\u2019re in a bad relationship, maybe you\u2019ve got a trauma, or perhaps gambling is your way of self-sabotaging\u2014because you believe you don\u2019t deserve to be happy and it\u2019s your brain afraid to get out of that familiar state of misery. Gambling can also just be that hormone deficit, and the rush or thrill gives you the boost you need. But if that is the case, then you are in luck, because this is the easiest form of addiction to beat in my perspective\u2014because you can simply replace gambling with something much healthier. Personally, I am not addicted to gambling; I am addicted to being addicted to at least one thing that makes my dopamine flow.\n\n# You Don't Have to Go It Alone\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone; there are a lot of professionals willing to help you and guide you on your way to a better life. Don\u2019t try to cheat your way out of it by finding happiness in self-help stuff online; they usually don\u2019t work or take up all your time finding the right one\u2014running the risk that for every single method that fails, it will make you feel more and more miserable.\n\nHaving said that, even cognitive therapy is not a 100% guarantee\u2014and it also requires trial and error and a lot of effort. You have to really want it. A big problem with self-help and trusting algorithms with finding out what your problem is, is that you are self-diagnosing\u2014and self-diagnosing is one of the worst things you can do. If you get professional help, objective professionals will diagnose you, and the likelihood of them finding out what is actually wrong is much higher. Sometimes putting your trust in others can be a very good thing\u2014even when people around you have damaged you and your trust.\n\n# Mastering the Basics: Sleep, Nutrition, Exercise\n\nGet enough sleep, eat healthy, and do some actual research into what good nutrition means\u2014but be on the lookout for misinformation. Food science is a very grey area, and even the research can be unreliable because a lot of research out there is funded by malicious actors in the food industry. Try to exercise regularly; it doesn\u2019t have to be very intense. Just taking a walk, taking a swim, or riding a bicycle can be a good start. But also don\u2019t overdo it; running more than 15 kilometers per day is said to actually be damaging for your heart.\n\n*Sidenote: I seem to make some absolute statements about physical needs, but everyone is different and may have different sleep, nutrition, and exercise needs. Keep track of what works for you and make changes accordingly.*\n\n# Aiming for Steady State: Sustainable Hormone Balance\n\nDon\u2019t get tempted to go for quick-fixes; try to go for long-term rewards. Avoid situations and people that tempt you into bad habits. Don\u2019t fight your hormonal needs, but swap out the bad habits for healthy ones. Remind yourself that spiking a hormone or depleting it will have consequences that can last days, weeks\u2014or even linger for months.\n\n# Failure as Feedback: The Art of Bouncing Back\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged when you slip up or fail at first\u2014or for the 34th time. Learn from your mistakes and try to do them differently the next time; allow yourself to be imperfect. Most very successful people we know were serial failures until they finally managed to succeed\u2014the difference is they didn\u2019t give up until they made it. That doesn\u2019t mean you should make the same mistake over and over again; that, according to Einstein, is the definition of insanity. (Yes, I know he was talking about solving math problems, not human behaviour.)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThe thought that keeps coming back\u2014and something that I stand behind completely\u2014is that no books, therapy, supplement, lifestyle, or whatever will get you to quit addiction; neither will my writing. The only way to take the step out of the spiraling downward circle is if you have suffered enough\u2014and you simply cannot suffer this way any longer. Whatever you will find at the moment your suffering has become too great will be the thing that helps you recover from any and hopefully all of your addictions.\n\nBe sure that the solution is sustainable and be aware of traps and self-sabotage. Many addicts have to try several times before being successful, and when their abstinence is longer than several weeks, the relapses are almost always self-sabotage or other cognitive patterns\u2014because the body has adapted to a lifestyle without addiction after a few weeks or months, but the mind can take years, and if left unattended, it will turn on you within a heartbeat.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to every silly thing your mind tells you. You are not your thoughts\u2014they tend to be inaccurate and noisy.\n\nThis was so long; I absolutely spiked my adrenaline and dopamine for this, and it will cost me the next few days, but I hope it\u2019s worth it... Do as I say, don\u2019t do as I do!",

    "Content":"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an addict. I find it hard to call myself that without feeling all \u201coh! woe is me\u201d, but like.. for the past 3 years I have felt like I needed some type of drug to just to get through my day to day life. My drug of choice has changed a few times, but the most important thing to me was just *not* being sober. Drugs became the only thing that could make me actually get up. Like if I was out, the only thing I was able to make myself do was.. go get more. If not that I was bedrotting. \n\nMy partner (we\u2019ll call Y) is a recovering actual addict. They were doing drugs for way longer than me, and way harder drugs too. I know you really can\u2019t compare your insides to others insides to see if you are valid, but I hard not to. They go to AA and NA meetings multiple times a week, and is currently more than 100 days sober, which ik is still fresh, but longer than I\u2019ve ever gone. Since we started living together I have been trying to get sober, a lot because I know I can\u2019t be doing drugs while living with a recovering addict (that would never end well). I did try a little bit to get off xanax before meeting them, but it never worked. \n\nI go with them to AA and NA sometimes and just feel so out of place. I don\u2019t feel like I am \u201caddict enough\u201d to be there. I am 18 and have only been using drugs regularly for like 3 years. \n\nI feel like a fraud in my \u201caddiction\u201d, and at the same time like a fraud in my sobriety. \n\nEvery time I know I am going to be away from Y for more than a few hours my brain is like \u201cDO DRUGS NOW\u201d. I try to have some fucking self control but almost always end up caving and if I have to do something even remotely stressful by myself Im all the way cooked, like no shot. I haven\u2019t thrown away any of my stash cuz I\u2019m scared, but like am I even really trying to be sober at that point? Do I even want to get better?\n\nAnd now I\u2019m just questioning my original intention and reason for attempting to be sober. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to get sober for the right reasons. Or if I will ever be able to actually stay sober if I go into it with my current mindset.\n\nSoo basically I don\u2019t really give a fuck what happens to me. Like, I wouldn\u2019t say I *hate* myself, it\u2019s more like I don\u2019t believe I really matter or have value..\ud83d\udc80 (That sounds so depresso espresso, but c\u2019est la vie) \nFor a bit I though I might\u2019ve actually wanted to get sober for me as well as them, but after I was (technically) raped (according to Y) during a big xan and speed relapse (couldn\u2019t consent cuz I was blacked tf out) and the only thing I was worried about was if I had hurt or disappointed Y by relapsing (and the man, but mostly relapsing cuz we weren\u2019t official then) I realised.. bitch, I\u2019m not doing this for me at all.\nSo like why would I care if I fuck my brain up with drugs, get raped, or fucking die? Like idk!! The only thing that matters to me is that I don\u2019t hurt THEM. The main reason I\u2019m trying to stay sober is so that I can be good for my partner and not trigger them. The last thing I would ever want is to make them relapse. So basically I think the reason why I keep relapsing when I\u2019m alone is cuz my brain is telling me it doesn\u2019t matter cuz Y isn\u2019t here to get triggered..\n\nI feel like I\u2019m faking being sober, even though I don\u2019t mean to lose control and relapse, I just don\u2019t know how to stop myself when I\u2019m alone because, like I said, I see no reason to. I don\u2019t do it for me. Which makes me feel like me trying to be sober at this point in my life is just useless. I believe that if you go into things like sobriety\/recovery with the wrong intention, it\u2019s just not gonna work. And that makes me think\u2026 If I\u2019m not going to be able to stay sober I really shouldn\u2019t be with my partner, because 1. It could so easily fuck with their sobriety and recovery if they knew about it and 2. I never know how to tell them about my relapses cuz I know they would be disappointed, but the last thing I want is to have this relationship be built on secrets and lies.. \n\nSo I\u2019m like\u2026 what do I do? \nIs there a way to change my view on sobriety, myself, addiction, all of that stuff.. do I have to end it and move out? I don\u2019t know. Please I just need advice generally, or like what would you do? Or just anything, I feel so alone. I think Y is the only person I know who would get it, but I don\u2019t know what to tell them.. \n\nSorry this was so extremely long,, but help pls \ud83d\ude14\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Content":"This is my story and I think it's worth telling, I also want someone to be excited with me. I don't have many people to tell about this. I have achieved so much so this is how l'm gonna celebrate, by telling my story. As well as I hope it inspires others who have been or are in my situation.\nTrigger Warning: This story discusses assault, PTSD, addiction, and suicidal thoughts.\nThree years ago, I was starting freshman year in highschool. I was a young happy girl who liked spending time with friends. I enjoyed music and preforming in my highschools drama class. And then my life changed forever.\nI was brutally attacked, and in an instant, I went from being a happy, carefree kid to feeling completely worthless, alone, and lost in depression. I struggled with PTSD, nightmares and flash backs, but for a long time, I refused to seek help. Instead, I turned to substances. I smoked weed, used nicotine, and\nexperimented with other things to escape the pain. They at the time were the only thing that actually provided any relief for me. And I became heavily addicted.\n\nEventually, my parents caught on-but only after I hit rock bottom. They intervened when I attempted to take my own life. After that, I transferred to online school, hoping for a fresh start. But my reputation followed me. I had become someone I barely recognized - constantly under the influence and seeking validation in all the wrong places.\nAt some point, though, something changed. I started watching inspirational videos, desperately wanting to feel good about myself again. Slowly, I began to believe that I could take back control of my life. So, I made a decision: I was going to get sober.\nIt wasn't easy. I relapsed several times and had to cut off people who weren't good for me. But after months of trying-really trying\u2014| did it. I got clean. It felt like I had accomplished the impossible. Though I still get cravings and impulses to relapse, I am currently over two years sober. After this time I met my now boyfriend. Who has been nothing but an incredible support through my struggles, so he deserves a mention. I love him very much, and he's a very good man. He helped me feel safe, he encouraged me to get professional help, and stayed with me through my nightmares and struggles. He is genuinely the love of my life. And now we've been together just under two years.\n\nDuring my junior year, still struggling with anxiety and depression, and ptsd, I focused on my mental health while attending online school. I was placed in an academic program where attendance was flexible, but due to a typo, l never received the email explaining how in the program you have to fill out very specific attendance forms. Because of this, I unknowingly racked up too many unexcused absences, and by the time I realized it, I had lost credit for an entire semester-eight full classes. I was devastated.\nIt felt like my future had slipped through my fingers. It was going to be very difficult to graduate let alone get into any good college. I felt very defeated.\nWhen my family moved, I decided to return to public school for my senior year, even though I seriously considered dropping out. I was starting with a 1.7 GPA-a number so low it felt impossible to recover from. But going back to public school was the best decision I could have made. I got a fresh start, made incredible friends, started working part-time, and, most importantly, I got help. I began therapy, got on proper medication for my PTSD, and finally found the courage to speak up about my attack.\n\nWhen I met with my academic advisor, she told me she had never seen a student retake this many credits or raise this low of a GPA high enough to get into college. But she also told me something that stuck with me\u2014if I was dedicated enough, she believed I could do it.\nSo, we made a plan.\nFor weeks on end, I stayed after school to retake classes and complete assignments. This semester, I took 12 classes. My schedule was brutal. I woke up at 7 AM for school, stayed until 3:30 PM, went straight to work at 4:15 PM, and didn't get home until 11:30 PM. Sleep was a luxury I couldn't afford. But I pushed through. I worked harder than I ever had before. And somehow, I did it. My grades soared\u2014| was getting A's and B's across the board.\nThen, today happened.\n\nI was sitting in third period, finishing an assignment when I decided to check my email.\nI wasn't expecting much-maybe a generic response from one of the colleges I applied to.\nBut then, I saw it.\nAn email from my dream school. My #1 choice.\nI was freaking out when I opened it expecting to read a polite rejection or a simple \"Thank you for applying.\" But instead, I saw a word I never thought l'd see:\n\"Congratulations!\"\nI had to fight back tears.\nIt took three-almost four-years, but I made it.\nI survived. I fought through every setback, every dark moment, every doubt. And now, not only am I graduating, but I'm going to my dream college.\nFor the first time in a long time, I realize just how strong I am.\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for listening to my story. I feel so blessed and proud of how far l've come, and I wanted to share this moment with you.\n\nPlease remember this: You are so much stronger than you realize. Even when it doesn't feel like it, you are doing an incredible job.\nKeep pushing forward. It really does get better.\nJust take it one step at a time and give yourself the grace and space you need to grow and heal. Thank you for reading, I am so excited to go to college and graduate. Just know you can absolutely do it. Getting sober, and overcoming your struggles are so worth it. Life isn\u2019t perfect, I still struggle with ptsd, and cravings. But I\u2019ve learned how beautiful the world really is, and I\u2019m so happy and fulfilled. You can do this, I promise. Again thank you for reading my story \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

    "Title":"Do I count as addicted? It feels like every substance I try just becomes the only thing I can think about for days",
    "Content":"I used to be dependent on and addicted to methylphenidate, but it\u2019s been almost a year since the last time I quit. A few days ago, in a moment of weakness, I looked everywhere for where I\u2019d put my last bit of it. I couldn\u2019t find it; I must have thrown it away when I thought I\u2019d recovered. I couldn\u2019t turn to my other old coping mechanism (cutting myself) because I knew that would escalate quickly, and I\u2019ve promised myself that I\u2019ll never commit suicide.\n\nSo, I got some vodka. I\u2019d never had anything more than a glass of wine with dinner because I don\u2019t like depressants. My goal for getting high is always to feel paranoid and jittery. Even the crash is something I look forward to, because it makes me feel like a real human who deserves help. It\u2019s the same rollercoaster of feelings as cutting was, but without the visible marks. Anyway, alcohol was my only option, so it\u2019s what I turned to. I drank until I got spooked by the effects, took a break for a few hours, then resumed drinking, only stopping when I puked.\n\nAfter that one night two days ago, drinking has been the only thing I could think about. I just wanted to be drunk. So the next night, I downed some vodka. Not quite as much, but I finished off the small bottle (I\u2019d gotten the smallest bottle because I didn\u2019t expect to like it).\n\nThe night after, which was yesterday, I didn\u2019t drink. I just laid in bed for hours, crying, texting my boyfriend that I was feeling down (he doesn\u2019t know I have issues with substances), staring at a new vodka bottle I\u2019d gotten that day. My boyfriend was smoking weed with friends, and he told me that over text, which really hurt because, even though I know he does that stuff, it bothers me. Maybe it bothers me just that he does it, maybe it bothers me that he can do it without it consuming his every thought. Probably both. But anyway, I made it though the night without drinking.\n\nToday though, it seems that I\u2019m going to give in and get drunk. I enjoy the feeling now; methylphenidate requires so much energy and effort, whereas alcohol encourages clumsiness and lethargy. And part of why I use substances is to prove to myself that I\u2019m doing poorly. I hide my struggles from everybody, so this is something that I know my friends and boyfriend would care about if I told them. I can\u2019t tell them though, because I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m seeking attention.\n\nSorry for the wordy explanation, but my question is: am I addicted to alcohol? I\u2019ve only used it like this twice, and just over the past few days",

    "Title":"How To Live A Recovery Lifestyle \u2013 Tips From A Peer Recovery\nSupport Specialist",
    "Content":"By: Katherine Blunt\n\n\n\nRecovery\/Addictions\/Lifestyle\n\n\n\nHow To Live A Recovery Lifestyle \u2013 Tips From A Peer Recovery\n\nSupport Specialist\n\nAs a person living in recovery from Substance Use Disorder for the past 6 years, I have\n\ndeveloped some basic methods and tools that I use to maintain my recovery and\n\nreclaim my life. I work as a peer recovery support specialist at my community health\n\ndepartment. My job is one of the driving forces that helps me maintain my recovery.\n\nThere is something so special about sharing your experiences to help someone else\n\nfind the light in their darkness. In addition to my job, I practice self-awareness to keep\n\nmyself on my toes, and I check in with myself about my emotions and the state of my\n\nmental health to ensure my sobriety.\n\nSubstance use disorder (SUD) is a challenging journey that impacts not just the body\n\nbut also the mind and spirit. What I have learned is that living in recovery is not merely\n\nabout abstaining from substances; it\u2019s about rebuilding a balanced and healthy life. At\n\nthe heart of this process is mental health and wellness. By prioritizing mental well-being,\n\nwe, in recovery can strengthen their resilience, address underlying emotional pain, and\n\nbuild a foundation for sustained sobriety.\n\nWhy Mental Health Matters in Recovery\n\nSubstance use often masks deeper issues such as trauma, anxiety, depression, or\n\nunresolved emotional pain. For me, I didn\u2019t want to feel any of it. Without addressing\n\n\n\nthese underlying challenges, the risk of relapse increases. Mental health and wellness\n\npractices provide tools to:\n\n1. Understand Emotional Triggers: Recognizing the emotions and situations that\n\nlead to cravings can empower individuals to respond constructively.\n\n2. Rebuild Self-Worth: Substance use can erode self-esteem. Mental health\n\npractices help individuals rediscover their value and purpose.\n\n3. Develop Coping Strategies: Healthy coping mechanisms reduce the reliance on\n\nsubstances to manage stress or discomfort.\n\n\n\nMindfulness Techniques in Recovery\n\nMindfulness or the ability to be self-aware is an empowering practice. It can help you\n\nidentify your emotions and stress levels and use the necessary tools to work through\n\nthem. Deep breathing techniques are my go to when I feel an anxiety attack coming on.\n\nI am able to say to myself \u201cIt\u2019s ok. Calm down. This is just your anxiety, and it will pass.\u201d\n\nI also practice making gratitude lists daily. It is too easy to focus on the negatives and\n\nthe have-nots. Making a gratitude list every day is a pleasant reminder of all the things\n\nthat I do have and value. Things that I didn\u2019t have in addiction and thought I would never\n\nobtain.\n\nMindfulness is a powerful tool for recovery. By fostering awareness and presence,\n\nmindfulness helps individuals:\n\n\n\n\uf0b7 Reduce Stress: Practices like meditation, deep breathing, and body scans calm\n\nthe mind and body, reducing the stress that often triggers cravings.\n\n\uf0b7 Enhance Emotional Regulation: Mindfulness helps individuals observe their\n\nemotions without judgment, allowing them to respond rather than react\n\nimpulsively.\n\n\uf0b7 Cultivate Gratitude: Simple mindfulness exercises, such as journaling about\n\npositive experiences, shift focus from negativity to positivity, improving overall\n\noutlook.\n\n\uf0b7 Use Mindfulness and Affirmation Cards: Tools like mindfulness cards or\n\npositive affirmation cards provide daily reminders to stay present, encourage\n\npositivity, and foster resilience.\n\n\uf0b7 Make Gratitude Lists: Regularly listing things you are grateful for fosters a\n\npositive mindset and helps shift focus away from challenges.\n\n\n\nEMDR Therapy: Healing from Trauma\n\nI recently started my journey with EMDR therapy. It is something I have been putting off\n\nfor fear of the discovery process. So far it has been an enlightening experience. It\u2019s not\n\neasy, that\u2019s for sure, but I feel it is the next necessary step for me to overcome some of\n\nthe barriers I struggle with.\n\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is particularly\n\neffective for individuals recovering from SUD who have experienced trauma. EMDR\n\nhelps:\n\n\uf0b7 Process Traumatic Memories: By reprocessing distressing memories,\n\nindividuals reduce their emotional intensity and impact.\n\n\uf0b7 Break Negative Thought Patterns: EMDR can help shift self-defeating beliefs,\n\nsuch as \\&quot;I\u2019ll never recover,\\&quot; into more empowering narratives.\n\n\uf0b7 Strengthen Emotional Resilience: Over time, individuals build the capacity to\n\nface triggers without relapsing.\n\nThe Role of Regular and Group Therapy\n\nI thrive in group therapy. I go to group therapy once a week. I appreciate the feedback\n\nfrom the other members. I also enjoy the bonding that is done by sharing our stories\n\nwith each other. It\u2019s so easy to learn from others when you have shared similar\n\nexperiences. It is also easier to identify certain things in someone else and then relate\n\nthem back to yourself. The members of my group therapy provide a mirror that I can see\n\nmyself clearly in.\n\n\n\nTherapy provides a safe space for individuals to explore their thoughts and emotions,\n\nunderstand their behaviors, and develop healthier patterns. Both individual and group\n\ntherapy play essential roles:\n\n\uf0b7 Individual Therapy: Personalized sessions allow for in-depth exploration of\n\npersonal struggles, goals, and progress. Therapists can tailor strategies to meet\n\nspecific needs.\n\n\uf0b7 Group Therapy: In group settings, individuals find community and support.\n\nSharing experiences fosters connection and reduces the isolation often\n\nassociated with addiction.\n\nMental Health Check-Ins: Building Consistency\n\nRegular mental health check-ins\u2014whether with a therapist, a trusted support group, or\n\nthrough self-reflection\u2014are vital in maintaining progress.\n\nI practice mental health check-ins with myself regularly. Being able to identify how you\n\nare feeling in the current moment is so powerful. It can help you to accept where you\n\nare right now and where you want to be both emotionally and in life. These check-ins:\n\n\uf0b7 Identify Emerging Issues: Early detection of stressors or negative thought\n\npatterns allows for timely intervention.\n\n\uf0b7 Track Progress: Reflecting on how far one has come boosts motivation and\n\nconfidence.\n\n\uf0b7 Reinforce Healthy Habits: Routine check-ins help solidify practices like\n\nmindfulness, gratitude, and self-care.\n\nJournaling for Reflection and Growth\n\nJournaling can be difficult, but it is a great outlet. I don\u2019t journal every day. I\u2019m just not\n\ndisciplined enough. However, I do try to journal when moments of joy, pride, sorrow, or\n\nunsureness happen in my life.\n\nJournaling is a transformative tool in recovery. By writing regularly, individuals can:\n\n\uf0b7 Process Emotions: Journaling provides a safe outlet for exploring and\n\nunderstanding emotions.\n\n\uf0b7 Track Progress: Recording daily experiences and milestones highlights growth\n\nand areas needing improvement.\n\n\uf0b7 Enhance Clarity: Reflective writing helps organize thoughts, set goals, and build\n\nself-awareness.\n\nThe Importance of Eating Healthy and Regular Exercise\n\n\n\nI struggle with this one. I was raised in a household where you ate your feelings. It has\n\nbeen one of the hardest habits to break in my life. My relationship with food is pretty\n\nunhealthy most of the time. However, when I do practice healthy eating habits, I notice\n\nhow much better I feel and how much more energy I have. So, I continue to work\n\ndiligently at improving my overall health with diet and exercise. I also include vitamins\n\nand supplements to help regulation of my body and mind.\n\nPhysical health plays a crucial role in supporting mental health and recovery. Two key\n\ncomponents are:\n\n\uf0b7 Eating Healthy: A balanced diet provides essential nutrients that boost brain\n\nfunction, stabilize mood, and improve energy levels. Consuming whole foods,\n\nsuch as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, supports overall well-\n\nbeing and reduces the risk of emotional instability.\n\n\uf0b7 Regular Exercise: Physical activity releases endorphins, the body\u2019s natural\n\nmood elevators. Exercise helps reduce stress, improve sleep, and enhance self-\n\nesteem. Activities like walking, yoga, or strength training can be tailored to\n\nindividual fitness levels and preferences.\n\nSelf-Care Techniques: Prioritizing Your Well-Being\n\nOk guys this one is SO important! Self-care. As a full-time Peer Recovery Support\n\nSpecialist and single mom it is so difficult to find time for my self-care routine. Honestly,\n\nit requires a level of discipline to ensure that you actually make time for yourself\n\nthroughout the busy week. Early in my recovery my self-care was small. I treated myself\n\nto a manicure and pedicure once a month. As time went on and I rediscovered other\n\nthings that I enjoy doing my self-care got easier and I realized it didn\u2019t have to cost me\n\nany money. A walk with my headphones in and music playing. A kayaking trip on a quiet\n\nlake. A bubble bath with some candles and a book. These are all simple ways I practice\n\nmy self-care routine.\n\nSelf-care is essential for maintaining balance and well-being during recovery. By\n\ndedicating time to self-care, individuals can nurture their mental, emotional, and\n\nphysical health. Some effective self-care techniques include:\n\n\uf0b7 Creating a Routine: Establishing a daily routine provides structure and stability,\n\nreducing feelings of chaos or overwhelm.\n\n\uf0b7 Setting Boundaries: Learning to say no and protecting personal time ensures\n\nthat energy is preserved for meaningful activities and relationships.\n\n\uf0b7 Engaging in Hobbies: Pursuing interests and creative outlets, such as art,\n\nmusic, or gardening, fosters joy and self-expression.\n\n\uf0b7 Practicing Relaxation: Activities like taking a warm bath, reading a book, or\n\nenjoying nature help reduce stress and promote inner peace.\n\n\n\n\uf0b7 Incorporating Positive Affirmations: Reciting positive affirmations daily builds\n\nconfidence and shifts focus toward optimism and hope.\n\nFocusing on Balance in Your Life\n\nBalance in your life is the ever-elusive goal for everyone. Early in my recovery process\n\nwhen I was court ordered to complete IOP (intensive outpatient program), they drilled\n\nthe balance wheel into our heads. I hated that wheel! Because who can achieve\n\nbalance in their lives? It seemed like an unattainable goal, even for someone not facing\n\nthe barriers of addiction recovery. Here is what I have learned. It may not be attainable.\n\nThe purpose is to remain aware of it and check in on where you are. It\u2019s simply a tool to\n\nsee where you are focusing most of your energy and where you need to focus some\n\nmore energy.\n\nAchieving and maintaining balance is a cornerstone of successful recovery. Balance\n\ninvolves:\n\n\uf0b7 Work-Life Harmony: Avoid overloading on work or recovery activities while\n\nneglecting leisure or relationships.\n\n\uf0b7 Emotional Equilibrium: Strive to balance challenging emotions with positive\n\nexperiences and coping tools.\n\n\uf0b7 Time Management: Allocate time for self-care, responsibilities, and relaxation to\n\nprevent burnout and enhance overall well-being.\n\nUsing the Balance Wheel of Life in Recovery\n\nThe Balance Wheel of Life is a visual tool designed to help individuals evaluate\n\nand improve different areas of their life, ensuring they are balanced and well-\n\nrounded. This tool is particularly effective in recovery as it encourages individuals\n\nto focus on various aspects of their lives rather than solely their recovery journey.\n\nThe wheel typically includes categories such as:\n\n1. Physical Health: Fitness, diet, and overall well-being.\n\n2. Emotional Well-being: Mental health, emotional regulation, and mindfulness.\n\n3. Relationships: Family, friendships, and social connections.\n\n4. Career\/Work: Job satisfaction, purpose, and professional growth.\n\n5. Spiritual Growth: Sense of purpose, spirituality, or connection with something\n\ngreater.\n\n6. Finances: Stability, budgeting, and financial goals.\n\n7. Recreation\/Fun: Leisure activities and hobbies.\n\n8. Personal Growth: Education, self-improvement, and skill development.\n\n\n\nSteps to Use the Balance Wheel:\n\n\uf0b7 Self-Assessment: Rate each area on a scale of 1-10 based on satisfaction or\n\nfulfillment. This creates a visual representation of where balance may be lacking.\n\n\uf0b7 Set Goals: Focus on areas with lower scores and set achievable goals to\n\nimprove them. For example, if emotional well-being is low, prioritize therapy or\n\nmindfulness practices.\n\n\uf0b7 Monitor Progress: Regularly revisit the wheel to evaluate changes and ensure\n\ncontinued balance.\n\n\uf0b7 Celebrate Achievements: Recognize improvements in any area, reinforcing\n\nmotivation and positivity.\n\nBenefits of Balance:\n\n\uf0b7 Prevents Burnout: Focusing solely on one area, such as work or recovery\n\nactivities, can lead to exhaustion. The wheel encourages diverse self-care.\n\n\uf0b7 Improves Resilience: A balanced life helps individuals handle stress and\n\nchallenges without turning to substances.\n\n\uf0b7 Fosters Joy: Prioritizing recreation and relationships nurtures happiness and\n\nfulfillment, essential for long-term recovery.\n\n\n\nBuilding a Holistic Recovery Plan\n\nI like outlines. I feel like when you have an outline to stick to it makes the steps to reach\n\nyour goals clear and attainable. Building a holistic recovery plan can help you stay on\n\ntrack and take back your life. You are not \u201cwinging\u201d it. You are following an outline that\n\nyou have created and personalized to your life and situation. I\u2019m not saying if you follow\n\nthe plan there will not be missteps, but at least you know how to regroup and start again\n\nif you are following your outline.\n\nMental health and wellness are most effective when integrated into a holistic recovery\n\nplan. This plan may include:\n\n1. Physical Health: Regular exercise and a nutritious diet support mental clarity\n\nand emotional stability.\n\n2. Social Support: Connecting with loved ones, mentors, and recovery groups\n\nstrengthens emotional support networks.\n\n3. Spiritual Growth: Practices like yoga, meditation, or attending spiritual\n\ngatherings nurture a sense of purpose and connection.\n\n\n\n4. Self-Care and Balance: Prioritizing self-care and maintaining balance ensures\n\nsustained progress and resilience.\n\n5. Mindfulness and Journaling: Incorporating tools like mindfulness cards,\n\naffirmation cards, and journaling promotes ongoing self-reflection and positive\n\ngrowth.\n\n6. Gratitude Lists: Regularly writing gratitude lists reinforces a positive perspective\n\nand fosters appreciation for the progress made.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe journey to a lifestyle of recovery is challenging. There are many barriers to\n\novercome your past and learn to live in the present. It is a never-ending road, but there\n\nis strength in resilience, and if nothing else addicts are resilient. I don\u2019t have it all figured\n\nout. I have good days and bad days like anyone else, but I wanted to share the vital\n\ntools that have gotten me this far and continue to get me through. I\u2019ve learned that\n\nrecovery from substance use disorder is a journey of transformation. It requires\n\ncommitment to mental health and wellness. By embracing practices like mindfulness,\n\nEMDR therapy, regular and group therapy, mental health check-ins, eating healthy,\n\nregular exercise, self-care techniques, and a focus on balance, we can heal deeply and\n\nbuild a life of stability and joy. Remember, recovery is not just about overcoming the\n\npast\u2014it\u2019s about creating a hopeful and fulfilling future.\n\n  \nCheck out my blog and recovery community [katherineblunt.podia.com](http:\/\/katherineblunt.podia.com) for tips, tools, resources and worksheets to help further your recovery.

    "Title":"Epiphany during a relapse?",
    "Content":"Before getting sober, I used every day. Both alone and with others. It was just my normal, and quitting meant completely changing how I lived my life. I was sober for 5 months, then relapsed. After that, I made it another 5 months and relapsed again. I didn\u2019t plan it this way, but it\u2019s strange that both times, I made it to the same point before slipping. Has anyone else experienced relapsing at a similar streak length?\n\nThis time, it wasn\u2019t even that I expected it to feel good.. I didn\u2019t really expect anything. I was just feeling really lonely being sober and ended up hanging out with people from before, which led to the relapse. The weird thing is, I could have had the epiphany\u00a0before\u00a0it even happened because the experience itself had nothing to do with it. It feels like my mind can\u00a0only\u00a0reach those realizations while being on the drug, which makes me question if the epiphany is even real. But at the same time, it feels healthy, like I finally understand things I\u00a0need\u00a0to understand to actually stay sober. \n\nFor example, when I\u2019m sober, I romanticize using and feel like my sober life is empty. But when I relapse, I realize I actually love my sober life way more. It\u2019s like my brain is playing both sides, and I don\u2019t know how to hold onto the clarity I have right now.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I forget why I quit.. I\u00a0know\u00a0how bad it was. But when I\u2019m sober, I start feeling like it isn\u2019t worth it because the loneliness is worse than being an addict. That\u2019s what keeps pulling me back.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How do you deal with the loneliness without convincing yourself that going back is the better option? And what are your thoughts on the \"epiphany\"?",

    "Title":"2 weeks or so as I started \"serious\" recording of my sobriety progress... cravings again",
    "Content":"Dear all,\n\nThis is my entry to the discussion of the progress. Or ranting, to a large extent.\n\nBecause it's been since I got really drunk, high on coke (again) until Monday 10AM. Maybe, my drinking etc. worsened due to my ex-wife leaving due to: alcoholism\/addiction, me wanting to fuck other girls, her not living comfortably in abroad (since no job for her, and only because of me).\n\nI mean, the whole chain of events and the whole story is (like always) very intertwined, and difficult to conceptualize? To some extent. Well, at least with alcohol it was ever since my mother passed of cancer 10 years ago (29M now). And drugs, they were on and off, but recently - quite on (maybe since after Covid started).\n\nAnd now, to the work part. So after this 10th of March, I decided to seriously stop it. It is very easy to proclaim especially in the first-second day. Like, \"it is boring\", and in fact, there is nothing fun about getting drunk and then high, and then feeling that only for 1-2 hours, and then just feeling like it really is nonsensical. But days come, you feel the routine, stress, etc., etc., and start feeling like \"ok, 3 day, feels easy...\", then \"4 day\" (which is today).\n\nSo exactly today, I feel, like it started to get worse. It was even from yesterday, but today - especially.\n\nSo, yesterday and today I started doing my work, ok, I do it relatively fine, but I feel like I am lacking and underperforming potentially. Ok, today I had a more vivid dreaming (I notice that it's because of my sleep was actually fucked up without me noticing it).\n\nThen, after around 2.5 hours (I work from home, quite relaxed, flexible schedule, but still needs to be done) I found a sort of depression ongoing? Like, I see the sunny weather outside, and I just notice that I have the money, I don't need to pressurize myself, and I started feeling........ Like, it goes on and on, sometimes mixes, along the following lines:\n\n\\- I can relax, so maybe?\n\n\\- It is not very healthy, it is boring\n\n\\- I can not have a drink or anything, as it will lead to a binge drinking series and again, reset the time, while I want to get rid off it\n\n\\- Why the fuck do I have to suffer this craving?\n\n\\- I am not that special not to have the cravings - it is the consequence of my actions.\n\n\\- Maybe just one?\n\n\\- \\[Not a thought, but a feeling: Dull absence of joy in life and a desire to go out for some\\]\n\nSo, I was just lying in there, hoping for this to get over. But it did not get to the 2nd day motivation \"drinking is boring, fuck drinking!\"\n\nIt was like: \"I sort of need this shit to feel somewhat fine again! I know I can't get it, but I also fucking want it, and I can't do anything about wanting not to want that!\"\n\nI mean, it was not a very novel thought to me, I noticed this when I did the same attempt and had a relapse on saturday (when I went abroad to work, I just felt that I was feeling grumpy, annoyed, stressed, and I had a week ahead of me of work, so I felt like \"I needed a drink to get by, as I can't afford not to work properly.\" So, then it went to binge drinking, feeling alone and unwanted abroad, with my ex-wife gone, and there are all these foreign alien people to me, and so fuck it\" kind of process.\n\n  \nWhy in the hell can you not stop it?\n\nBecause, I was thinking (before) that \"ok, but this is what I want, not that SOMEONE ELSE wants\". So, once I try to stop, this was a surprise? Like \"Ok, now I don't want to do it, but why the fuck is it that I still actually want to do it?\"\n\nI mean, ex-wife and me we also tried to stop it. However, on around 10th day or so I felt this depression like \"fuck everything, I don't want to move\" and so even when travelling, even on her birthday parties, I was like \"I can't move, help plz\", like feeling stuck. Then, we had big arguments: she felt like I spoiled her birthday and fair enough, but it was also that I couldn't have done shit? I don't know, or maybe I could have?\n\nSo, this is all just so much fucking material to write and write and write and write and write and write and write and write and write............. Like, one thing leads to the next, and there is never a clear enough answer to how should I do it? Like, I want to feel the same feeling that I feel of joy when I am drunk\/cocained, but while sober. And I am 100% sure that it is possible. But I don't feel it?\n\nAnd so, I am just fucking stuck here. Like, it is so depressive on its own, feeling stuck.\n\nAnd maybe, it's a good thing, feeling stuck? It means that I can't go backward (meaning, that there is just boredom and really no \"caif\"). Though, I also can't go forward fast enough: like, the time just collapsed in on me: I was doing work, then I started feeling the craving, and so I started thinking, and thinking, etc.\n\nAnd so I couldn't even have done the work?..\n\nFucking hell..\n\n\n\n[Alcohol timeline](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8brqy7w51gre1.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d195ce343e0402ae7b2c15af227e26c18c86f1)\n\n[Cocaine timeline](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8kstgj971gre1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3b10aafa2ca049b7c92d03967c60e7fe09c467)\n\n",

    "Title":"19 years old SEVERE active drug addiction. My story.",
    "Content":"Might be a long one, just gonna type away. I\u2019m really looking to vent\/journal, but also need to get this off my chest.\n\nSo my mom was 19 when she had me and I believe my dad was in his mid-late 20s. They supposedly started off as a happy couple. Well that may have lasted a lil while but after about a year of having me they gave me over to my grandmother custody. Reason being my dad has a SEVERE drinking problem, and always has. He\u2019s an angry, confrontational drunk, and supposedly a violent one at that. \n\nAfter a really bad argument between the 2 one night, my drunken dad came home to baby me crying, and my mom getting onto him so he  allegedly snapped and became violent. Don\u2019t know all the details but I heard he got physical and beat hear and allegedly put a pistol to her head. In the past I\u2019ve heard hes driven me home drunk when I was a child, crashed into a hospital cus he was drunk, etc etc. \n\nFound out my dad\u2019s father, and his father, (so on so forth, are ALL alcoholics and hot headed angry people. So yeah, addiction definitely runs on dad\u2019s side.  So like I said I was raised in early childhood by my grandmother (my nana) alone in a small suburban townhome. Dad was absent. Mom became a fucking stripper. I\u2019ve had some issues since very early on in childhood. Started off as fine-motor skills, anger and focus issues and hyperactivity. So as you might\u2019ve guessed I was diagnosed with ADHD around 6 years old. That was my first diagnosis.\n\nIn kindergarten through early grade school I was CONSTANTLY getting notes home or sent to the principals office for normal mischievous activity. When I would get home my grandma would get sooo upset, but never hit me or anything but make me feel super guilty and when my mom would find out she would come home and whoop my ass and yell at me. I\u2019d say around 3rd grade is when my mental health first started declining. And it declined rapidly. \n\nI first remember having crippling anxiety around 8 or 9. It was ALWAYS worse in the morning. \n\nThis lead to my troubles at school getting worse and worse, and by 6th grade I was getting suspended and getting detention. I mean ALOT. Like every few days. This would be for things like threatening people, anger outbursts, cursing ppl out etc. I was also picked on pretty bad around this time for being skinny and bc I had buck teeth. This happened all thru middle school, and was the worst in grade 7. Having this happen constantly DEPRIVED me of self-esteem and confidence. Around 6th grade I started noticing some depression symptoms, which grew rapidly and turned into constant suicidal ideation. I became suicidal, and grew resentful towards people and isolated. This turned into extreme depression and I became developing violent fantasies. I had few friends and no real hobbies or sports.\n\nI had moved in with my mom and step-dad. He was ok at first, and always supported us majority financially, but his first anger outbursts started when I was 8. From grades 5-10 is when his anger was most prevalent. Peaking around grade 6-8. He would scream and curse at me and my mom, threaten me, throw and break stuff, and had a tendency to slap and hit me. My mom never did and still doesn\u2019t see anything wrong, and she was also verbally evil. Both of them forced me to call him \u201cdad\u201d, which part of me understands cus my bio dad is absent, but I still hated it for a long time. \n\nI started experimenting with nicotine and alcohol at age 14, 9th grade after moving to a new area during the start of COVID. Nicotine first I believe, and at first I didn\u2019t care for it. Until I actually inhaled. Got a crazy head rush and I was INSTANTLY hooked, so I\u2019ve been smoking nicotine since then. Had a best friend (my only real friend tbh) at this time who would come over and stay the night often. One night he mentioned going down to my step-dad\u2019s basement and swiping a couple beers. We snagged some tall boys and I couldn\u2019t stand the taste, lol. Ended up drinking maybe half the beer, and feeling pretty nice. He kept coming over and I started drinking more, and started finishing bottles. I loved it. I started drinking when he wasn\u2019t there, alone in my room at night, at school, and my step dad caught on to this and started putting alarms on his alcohol. \n\nI was miserable. I needed the feeling alcohol gave me. One evening I felt this feeling, and made a decision that opened the gates of hell in my life. I googled sum like \u201cways to get fucked up over the counter\u201d or sum like that. I read somewhere that you can hallucinate off Benadryl. I walked to the store that evening, and stole a box of Benadryl. I started researching how much to take to \u201cget high\u201d, and used an online calculator to measure my dose. I took 11 pills. 275mgs. It kicked in, and I started to hallucinate. It had so many horrible side effects but just the fact that I was hallucinating and not sober made me fall in love. I did it the next day, increased my dose slightly. I took some time off then I my use skyrocketed. I used pretty much every other day, occasionally taking a couple days off.\n\nI used it from ages 14-18. Using doses at high as 700mg. (1 Benadryl is 25mg) Benadryl fucked my body and brain up. My depression increased SIGNIFICANTLY, I would vomit every time I ate, had panic attacks & crippling anxiety, and my negative thinking became my only thinking. Around my 15th birthday I believe, I started using OTC cough syrup (DXM) after trying it in school one day. I felt incredible. This became my life. I would do it once every few days only because the high would sometimes last up to 3 days. From ages 15-19 I was using DXM constantly, and it became my ONLY thought in my head 24-7. I would do it before work, at school, at home, everywhere and anywhere. I started getting erratic, psychotic behavior from it.\n\nAfter one episode I ran miles away from my grandmothers house leaving her front door open and calling 911 on myself. Stuff like this started happening ALOT, but I never told anybody how bad my use was so they assumed it was mostly mental illness. I got put on lots of medicine. I got kicked out for this and sent to my dads. I used still all the time, but never got caught, Until I became paranoid and brought a knife to school in 11th grade. I got arrested for 3 days and placed on house arrest. I attempted to kill myself that night by swallowing lots of ibuprofen and silica gel. I survived and told my dad, got send to another mental hospital, and another one and other one, and this became the cycle. I was in and out of at least 25 mental wards and residential facilities. Staying in some of these places for as long as 9 months. I started using Adderall and benzos and started drinking again and smoking weed. I got arrested a few times, once for felony robbery (did half a year in juvy) and 2 times for assault.\n\nI had met a much older woman at age 16 who was 27 at the time and she was just super friendly at first, Writing page long letters while i was in facilities or locked up, calling and texting me paragraphs daily, etc. After getting released from Juvy on my 18th birthday, she told me she was in love with me. I had never really been in an actual relationship before. I got attached and so did she. She took my virginity on my 18th birthday when she was 29. We got engaged. We were in a relationship for just under a year. She broke up with me January this year for relapsing constantly. \n\nI now realize I was likely taken advantage of and groomed. I am still unable to process this correctly and am so hurt by it. I was a young naive teenager who didn\u2019t know any better. After the breakup my use skyrocketed. I moved into a sober living house and started EVERYTHING, and eventually started using meth. I recently picked up opioids too. As of most recently (late march 2025), I have had multiple occasions where I have been very close to homelessness and have absolutely no money. I lost my job after the breakup, and am using meth and opiates daily now. \n\nAt any point I could get drug tested and kicked out, but this doesn\u2019t deter me. I\u2019m too obsessed with getting high. I\u2019m currently working on getting a new job and a sponsor, but I\u2019ve been through that before. Feels like nothing can stop me. I\u2019m at a loss. \nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading. I really appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, ",

    "Title":"When Addiction Becomes a Family Disease",
    "Content":"Addiction isn\u2019t just self-destruction, it\u2019s a bomb that goes off in the middle of a family, leaving behind collateral damage that never fully heals. My brother-in-law is an alcoholic, and for years, I\u2019ve watched as his addiction consumed everything in its path. He is 37 years old and lives with his parents, leeches on them, emotionally, physically and financially. He lost his job months ago and he shows no desire to make anything of his life.\n\nI have tried to distance myself and reminded myself that his choices are not my responsibility. But addiction doesn\u2019t work like that. It creeps into every part of life. It turns family gatherings into tense, exhausting ordeals. It replaces love with resentment. It forces people into impossible situations, where there are no good choices, only the ones that hurt the least.\n\nI know that one day, when his parents are gone, he will have nowhere else to turn. And no matter how much I try to prepare myself for that reality, the weight of it feels unbearable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Consequences No One Wants to Talk About\n\nAddiction is messy. It\u2019s not just about the drinking, it\u2019s about everything that comes with it.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He gets so drunk that he pees himself in his sleep.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has been in multiple car accidents because he drives drunk.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He makes inappropriate, suggestive comments to women in public.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He sexually harasses my best friend every time he sees her.\n\nLast night was supposed to be special. We planned a birthday dinner for my mother-in-law\u2019s 60th, a moment to celebrate her. He showed up already drunk and embarrassed us all by leering at women who wanted nothing to do with him.\n\nThis is what addiction does. It takes moments that should be joyful and stains them with shame and discomfort.\n\nI used to feel anger. Now, mostly, I just feel tired.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Addiction Does to a Marriage\n\nMy husband and I never expected this to be part of our life together. I know he struggles with it as much as I do. He loves his brother. I love my husband. And yet, that love does nothing to change the situation.\n\nWe fight about his brother, not because I don\u2019t understand why things are the way they are, but because I see the future, and it terrifies me. When his parents are no longer here, what happens then? Where does that leave us?\n\nI don\u2019t want to resent my husband for his brother\u2019s actions. I don\u2019t want this to be a constant source of tension in our marriage. But I also can\u2019t ignore the reality that, if nothing changes, the burden of his addiction will eventually land on us. And I don\u2019t know how to make peace with that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Breaking Point\n\nThere are things I will never forgive my brother-in-law for.\n\nIn 2021, his father spent 11 months in the hospital, fighting for his life. He was on and off a ventilator, and we had to say goodbye more times than I can count. It was a year of grief, fear, and uncertainty.\n\nMy husband and I had just gotten married. A week after our wedding, we moved in with my mother-in-law to help her through the nightmare of nearly losing her husband. And then, out of nowhere, my brother-in-law moved in too.\n\nHe had been kicked out by his wife after sleeping with a prostitute. Instead of stepping up during the hardest time of his family\u2019s life, he spiralled deeper into his addiction.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He went on endless drinking binges.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He got into accidents while driving drunk.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He was violent toward his own mother.\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He verbally abused everyone around him.\n\nThere we were, trying to hold each other together, and instead of being a son, a brother, a human being, he became another source of pain, another problem no one knew how to solve.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Unspoken Truth About Addiction in Families\n\nPeople say, \u201cYou can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want to be helped.\u201d But what they don\u2019t say is what that means for the people left behind. The ones who have to live with the destruction. The ones who keep hoping, keep trying, keep getting disappointed.\n\nI don\u2019t have the luxury of pretending this doesn\u2019t affect me. Every time he humiliates himself in public, every time he refuses to take responsibility for his life, every time I have to sit in silence while he makes people uncomfortable, it eats away at something inside me.\n\nI wish I could walk away from it. I wish it didn\u2019t weigh so heavily on my life, my marriage, my peace of mind. But addiction doesn\u2019t give you that choice. It forces you to care, even when you don\u2019t want to. It forces you to watch, even when it\u2019s unbearable.\n\nI don\u2019t have answers. I don\u2019t know how to fix this. I don\u2019t know how to live with the knowledge that he will never change.\n\nWhat I do know is that I can\u2019t let his choices define my life. I can\u2019t let my anger consume me. I can\u2019t be the one who carries the weight of his addiction when he refuses to carry it himself.\n\nOne day, there will be a moment when I have to decide (when we all have to decide) how much more we are willing to sacrifice for someone who refuses to save himself.\n\nAnd when that moment comes, I hope I have the strength to choose myself.",

But my mom passed away a in 2022, I found evidence last summer and I haven\u2019t had a conversation with her as previous experience with drinking she just smiles and laughs it off or changes the subject. I also was scared to tell others because I didn\u2019t want it to push my sister further away. Now I have confirmation she is using again. And I don\u2019t know how to approach the situation. We don\u2019t have a lot of family or she doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends and she lives far away. How can I sit down and talk to her about this?  I feel stuck because I know if she brings it up she\u2019s going to disregard it or lie.  The only possible option I feel is to give her the ultimatum of cutting her out of my life.  How do I approach this ? I do need to actually see her and sit down and have a conversation with her. But do I get family and her friend involved ? Do I set up an intervention? Do I force her to get tested? I don\u2019t know what to do and I feel helpless. I know my moms passing really has affected us both but I honestly felt how hard my mom worked and provided to us that my sister would at least feel fortunate enough to do good in her life , but this is not the case. Any advice is really appreciative. I\u2019m in Canada and I don\u2019t even know any support or places to reach out to that can assist with this. I know it starts with the person wanting to get clean. I\u2019m stuck ",

    "Content":"daughter of a recovering raging alcoholic. let me preface that my mom would go through 2-4 handles of vodka a week for 10+ years up until a year or two ago. ended up in the ICU and finally turned her life around, quit drinking to that extent, and became a better person, but still purchases alcohol the moment she gets her hand on any money. it\u2019s not even a fraction as bad as it use to be, and i will give her credit for that. it\u2019s not even necessarily bad. my mom drinks socially here and there, but it\u2019s when she\u2019s by herself and drinks is where the issue comes back. she is a complete asshole when she drinks, and never limits herself when she is alone. which is why i\u2019m making this post. it\u2019s been several weeks since she\u2019s drank but i just came home from work and i could tell within 5 minutes of being home that she was drinking. and to my surprise she completely lied to me face, over and over and over again. she was on the phone with her friends when i came in. its the slurring, the carelessness towards anything around her, becoming a pathological liar to make me look bad, and coming into my room and my personal space despite me trying to get away from the situation. i\u2019m moving out next week, and her friends family was suppose to help get rid of furniture she didn\u2019t want anymore in the process (couches, dressers, mattresses) and she came into my room essentially telling me she expects me to do it now on top of packing for my move. i can tell she\u2019s been drinking because her rationale is down the drain. i\u2019m a 5\u20194 woman with barely any muscle, and i got yelled at because i told her i couldn\u2019t carry all that furniture downstairs from our apartment by myself. again, she lied that she hasn\u2019t been drinking. she could call me every name in the book, but lying to me about the thing that traumatized me throughout my entire childhood is so disheartening. the fact that i could instantly tell is also depressing. that\u2019s how used to i was. i get it\u2019s in the past, but it got to the point where i was blackmailed\/harmed if i didn\u2019t  help buy it for her. before i was even 21 i was stuck desperately trying to find ways to get vodka to her without being of age. she is disabled and refused to sign up for social security so i was paying for everything up until a couple months ago. hundreds of dollars a month would go towards it, out of my own paycheck while we struggled to get by every time. my entire life i have always been on edge, fighting stomach ulcers from anxiety, cutting off friends and relationships due to being scared to leave the house, and even getting in trouble at work because id be blackmailed to come home and fix whatever issue she was irrationally angry at. it\u2019s easy to say i could have up and left, but i had no where to go, and no one to ask for help. and i was scared she\u2019d do something to our cats if i left, since i likely wouldn\u2019t be able to take them with me. she\u2019s tried lighting our home on fire multiple times, and has broken and destroyed many of my personal items. we are on section 8 so our rent was decreased which was the only way i was able to afford paying for everything, and the only reason why i couldn\u2019t move out even if i did decide to leave her behind. so i can\u2019t believe that she\u2019d lie to my face, after everything she\u2019s been through to get better, and tell me that she hasn\u2019t been drinking. she resorts back to her old ways anytime she drinks, how could I not tell. i\u2019m just glad that she finally found herself an income, and that I have a wonderful partner that i will be moving in together next week and an amazing support outlet from my closest friends. i\u2019m glad to be leaving this part of my life behind, as it\u2019s the first time i\u2019ll ever be independent for myself only, and be living with someone who doesn\u2019t threaten me to blackmail and dox me with false information.

    "Content":"Gonna tell a bit of a story and then ask for some guidance: I deeply care for our closest neighbors who are living in abject squalor, some are in active addiction, and all are living hand to mouth, one government check at a time. 3 grown adults, 1 fresh 18yo. Far too many animals with not enough means or give a fuck to do better. I know wanting to help is only productive if they want to help themselves; they genuinely think there is nothing wrong with their lifestyle although I know they\u2019re uncomfortable most days and going without any semblance of general hygiene, home care, or animals care (no running water, no washer\/dryer, sheets, tooth brushing, regular bathing, flea or tick treatment for the animals, a mountain of trash in the yard full of human excrement just to name a few things). We are hoping to give them access to tools to clean up their living space, and I try to lend a hand with the animals, get them spayed\/neutered and their shots, help with food at the end of the month. I don\u2019t mind bridging the gap when I can if they\u2019re in a bind, but recently they took advantage of me, and I genuinely feel so hurt. Just don\u2019t steal and lie to my face about it. It wasn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s the principle, it\u2019s the disrespect. I knew not to trust them with too much, but I thought I could trust them with this. Part of me wants to not saying anything and just let my role in their lives dwindle and they\u2019ll forget we exist other than friendly neighborly waves from a distance, and part of me wants to sit the person down who stole and lied to me and attempt to impart onto them how shitty that was in light of everything. How shitty that is to do to anyone, period. What would you do? Let sleeping dogs lie, or try to mend what they broke? My husband thinks it\u2019s best to wait and see if they do what they have said they\u2019ll do to right their wrong, which I think is sage. I feel so stupid and naive for giving them any benefit of the doubt, but I really just want to give everyone a chance and up until now I felt they were decent, albeit, rough folks. What would you do?

    "Content":"I\u2019ve struggled with opiate addiction for ten years (pills for 4 years and heroin\/fentanyl for 6 years) at the peak of my addiction I was using 5 bundles or a brick\/movie everyday. I\u2019ve been clean for a month and 2 weeks now and on suboxone maintenance 8mg twice a day. The IOP I go to only offers vivitrol right now but there are other places where I can get sublocade. Some people told me vivitrol is more for alcohol and sublocade would be more suitable for me. What\u2019s the different and which do you think would be better for opiate abuse disorder?",

There's this one 'video' that has been bothering me and giving me urges, Its preventing me from focusing on my work, Now i am confused as if I should watch it and get it off my head once and for all OR i somehow continue with the streak, And i really hope god forgives me for what I did and helps me on my further decision",

It's totally worth it.\n\nI was miserable before, and I would say I drank because I was miserable. I was never suicidal, but I didn't care about being alive.

I actually look forward to the shit I need to get done instead of dreading it. Anxiety and depression have vanished (the Wellbutrin did a lot there). \n\nI'm not trying to be rainbows and sunshine and unicorns and \"YOU CAN DO IT!\" because I know how much those people annoyed me over the years, but seriously...

    "Content":"Two years ago, I was at my lowest. Addiction had completely taken over my life, I had lost family, friendships, and myself. I'd cycled through multiple treatment centers, never making it past 30 days sober. Honestly, I'd given up believing recovery was even possible for me. Then I found Windmill Wellness Ranch, and something shifted. They taught me recovery wasn't just about stopping substances it was about healing my mind, rebuilding relationships, and learning to love and respect myself again.\n\nRecovery transformed me in ways I never imagined possible. Today, my relationships with my family and friends aren't just repaired, they're genuinely thriving. I'm part of a community where I support others in their journey, too, through Drew's Sober Living. I spend my days helping others find hope, build new lives, and believe in themselves again. I work, I mentor, I have routines and habits that keep me grounded and healthy.\n\nWhat I want to share most of all is that no matter how dark or impossible things feel right now, recovery can genuinely transform your life. It\u2019s not just about quitting drugs or alcohol, but about discovering who you really are beneath the struggle, reconnecting with people you love, and building a life you're proud of. If you're feeling hopeless, please don't give up. The transformation is real, and it's waiting for you.",

    "Content":"Hey yall,  I hope everyone is doing well. Having a great day, and doing okay in life. Please feel free to vent in this comment section if you need. I know this isnt as extreme as some of the things ive read on here. I have other demons to fight, but i need to fight my longest one first. I started toying with nicotine at 12-13 years old. I was hanging around older kids and we were stealing their parents cigarettes. That lasted for about a year until they were now old enough to buy them, and my mother started buying them for me. I was heavily addicted, a pack a day for about 3 years until i became pregnant. Throughout the course of all of this if i dont have a cigarette in my hand its a vape. After i had my baby i continued with just vaping until that landed me back to smoking for a few more months. In November of 2021 I had my last cigarette. I lost my grandfather that October to Lung Cancer. Now fast forward nearly 4 years later and im still and avid vaper all this time. Im ready to give it a go. I like super sweet fruity flavors. I have tried Zyn and i just cant?? Maybe if anyone has specific flavor or milligram reccomendations? I literally wake up out of my sleep to hit my vape, vaping helped me get over car accident PTSD as silly as it sounds. It just seems impossible to me as its in my hand or lap 24\/7. ",

    "Title":"Hedonism",
    "Content":"Addiction can come in many forms. Drugs are, of course, the most addictive substances. They tickle the pleasure centers in the brain to release large quantities of dopamine. And, as if that wasn't enough, the adventure of finding drugs--going out into the world on a clandestine mission and indulging in the illicit--can be just as addictive as the physiological response itself. What I'm trying to say is that there is an undeniable allure to the acquisition of drugs that is hard to explain to those who have never partaken.  \n  \nAlthough it is hard to explain the many faces of addiction, I would venture to guess that everyone has been addicted to something at some point in their life. If not drugs, sex; if not sex, videogames; and if not videogames, true crime podcasts or Instagram or the social hour after church service that starts as a once a week obligation but turns into a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday affair. Of course not all addictions are as harmful as drugs, but since everyone has some type of addiction, we can use this knowledge to help explain, even in an imprecise or incomplete manner, what drug addicts feel and why they stay addicted against their own best judgment.  \n  \nTo this end, I've written [an essay for LIT Magazine](https:\/\/www.litmagazine.org\/the-hedonists-checklists\/) about addiction--food addiction--focusing on how an addiction can take control of one's life. And particularly focusing on how addicts feed on their addiction, becoming experts in their specific domain. From my experience, addicts are often very intelligent people. Drug addicts, for instance, know the ins and outs of the chemical composition of the drugs the use and they learned everything they can about drug paraphernalia, drug laws, and even the history of their favorite drug.  \n  \nI think what underlies this tendency is an obsessive personality that further feeds their addiction. Fortunately, drugs are just one outlet that can be used to express such obsession. If channeled into less harmful activities, the same obsession can be harnessed for benefit. To this end the ritual that surrounds harmful addictive activity needs to be broken and replaced in order to fill the void that inevitably develops when addicts seek a way out of their cycle of dependence.  \n  \nFood, which happens to be the topic of my essay on addiction, exemplifies how one's energy can be channeled into other obsessions. If you read the essay and make it to the end, I'd love to know if you believe I've captured the sense of loss that occurs when overindulgence in pleasurable activity becomes heartrendingly mundane.",

I had the most amazing childhood that adulthood literally came as a shock and it's no where near as great as I always thought it would be.\n\nBelow are my addictions and I just don't know how to overcome them and can't afford a therapist. I've seen a doctor in the past but they just offer medication which I don't want to take.\n\n1. Gaming\/gambling - i play several hours a day and the games have microtransactions that give me a buzz when I open packs but then instantly feel regret when I realise the money I've wasted. I've stopped playing for the last 3 days and packed away the PlayStation \n\n2. Alcohol - i drink heavily atleast 3 or 4 times a week where I often blackout. I'm so far a week from not drinking but having a beer is all I can think about\n\n4. Soda - I'm having a family size bottle pretty much every 2 days and just can't stop the habit. I've cut down to 1 can a day but I still crave it all day.\n\n5. Porn - TMI but I don't mastabate but rather just randomly watch it for no reason when I'm bored and I don't know why\n\n6. Vaping - i go through 1 disposable a day and I absolutely hate it but feel to addicted to stop. It makes me so tired and kills any motivation I have\n\nI don't understand why I'm so addicted to so many things. I know I'm not happy with where I'm at career wise which may be causing the problem but the addictions are almost holding me hostage and stopping me from being my best.",

    "Content":"I am currently mandated to six months of rehab by my drug court. Yesterday, the program co-director told me that because I was doing so good, that they would talk to my legals and see if I could leave early in a couple weeks and go to a halfway house for the last three months of my mandate. \n\nI am currently on 24mg of Suboxone, and have been trying to get the nurse and doctors to either get me off Suboxone or to switch me to something else instead, because Suboxone no longer does anything to prevent urges after taking it for six months. They've refused at every time, and if I decide not to take it for a day or two, they flip out on me and send emails to my counselor, so I feel forced to take it daily. Eventually, I would take it and then just hold onto it until night-time and take it then, because I don't like how it makes me feel during the day because I have to go to groups. When I first took Suboxone, it was great, I had absolutely no cravings whatsoever, but after being on it for so long, it just doesn't help with that anymore.\n\nToday, the nurse caught me trying to cheek it until night. I got told that they were kicking me off the MAT program and to not come down in the morning for it anymore. I thought whatever, no big deal. \n\nI get called down to the directors office today at three, and she accuses me of selling my medication to other clients, and said that she remembered that I was in her office once before begging her for another chance and that she gave it to me and now it bit her in the ass. That is a lie. I never ever have gotten in trouble here before, and I've never even been in her office before. Like I said, just yesterday they said that I was doing so good that I might be able to leave early. Now she is reporting to my legals that I am selling medication and that I am being discharged from the program, she is transferring me to a sister program in the same company of Samaritan Village.\n\nAfter this happened, the nurse told every single client that came to the window to get meds that I was caught cheeking my Suboxone and she told everyone who would listen that I'm being kicked out. She told the director and every client that went to the window that she's caught me three times now, which is also not true, this is the first and only time I've been caught doing it. \n\nSo my questions are; \n\n1. Is it legal for them to just cold turkey me off of medication that will give me withdrawal? \n\n2. Is it legal for the nurse to go around violating HIPPA laws by disclosing to clients what I take and bragging that she caught me? \n\n3. Is there anything I can do, like maybe call oasis, to get this rectified? Should I try calling my legals and explain what happened? \n\nI'm sure I have more questions but I'm tired and stressed and that's all that currently comes to mind. Any and all advice is welcomed, thank you all for your time and support. \n\n(Side note, if I was selling my medication, I would be going through withdrawal. I don't need to sell my medication because I have a supportive family that would send me any money I needed) ",

He thought he was moving away for good, but once he was gone, he realized how much he likes it here compared to... anywhere else he's found so far. So he came back, with a newfound appreciation for this place.\n\nI also just got done being sick as a dog.\n\nThis is the most normal I've felt in the past 5 days.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, does normal feel fugkin' great!\n\nI'm not even completely back to normal and already appreciating how much better life is.\n\n... and a similar dynamic happened with the chronic health problems that followed me around for years, too. As you may know, I struggled with very severe gut and skin health problems for about 10 years. And it's only over the past couple years where I've gotten to feel what it's like to\u00a0not\u00a0have those problems again.\n\nAnd to say that's a blessing would be an understatement.\n\nBut what's funny is that because it was a chronic condition, I wasn't actually fully aware of how much it was draining me.\n\nBecause we're incredible beings that adapt rather quickly to our circumstances.\n\nSo it's just been over the last couple years where I really fixed my gut health, and the consequences of that condition began to lift, where I realized just how much it had been holding back my cognition, physical health, confidence, and more.\n\nAnd the same thing happens with a man's p\\*\\*n habit, too.\n\nWhen it's been part of your life for so long, you adapt to the negative consequences of it. You probably aren't fully aware of them, and it's hard to imagine how things would be without it. Because you've adapted to this being your \"normal.\" Needing caffeine in the morning just to get the day started, struggling to find the motivation to get things done, and feeling a massive \"rift\" in your intimate life... all just normal.\n\nBut what if they didn't have to be anymore?\n\nIf p\\*\\*n's been a part of your life for a number of years, I'd bet almost anything that when you remove it you'll find that he whole world seems brighter.

    "Title":"I want to quit practicing addiction medicine!",
    "Content":"I've been practicing addiction medicine in some form for almost 26 years. Never in my career have I felt more defeated or wanted to quit as much as I do right now.\n\nI have a patient I've known since she was 17. Over the years, she became more than just a patient to me; she felt like one of my daughters. Even after she moved out of state, we kept in touch regularly. Her mother and I tried everything we could think of to help her become sober and to keep her alive.\n\nIn my career, I've only worked with patients who've already chosen to become sober. That's who walks into my office. She originally came to me with her mother for help at 17. Every doctor said she was addicted to opioids, but no one wanted to help because of her age. For them, it was incredibly challenging, frustrating, and heartbreaking. But I gladly took her in. At the time, I had a concierge addiction practice which meant I had all the time in the world to spend with each patient. I helped her become sober from opioids. I remembered that the text messages between her, her mother, and I numbered in the thousands. She stopped the opioids but the cocaine and benzodiazepines continued. I sent her to counseling, psychiatry for her mental health, but she just wouldn't stop. I wouldn't fire her because I feared she would ultimately relapse and die from an opioid overdose.\n\nShe eventually moved out of state but we kept in touch. Recently, she went into an inpatient facility and became sober from everything. However, she was not taking methadone or buprenorphine. So, I feared she would eventually have a lapse and return to opioids or another drug. PAWS is a real thing and most clinics don't warn patients. She maintained 8 weeks of sobriety and her mind was starting to clear up. She started to realized how F up her life was. She started speaking like a mature adult and had goals. Everything started getting better. Wow was the thought on my mind every time we talked. But I was so afraid of that lapse.\n\nSaturday, her mother sent me a text. She died from an overdose. The police believe it was from opioids based upon what they found. It\u2019s seriously haunting me.\n\nAll of my appointments are audio recorded. I've been listening to them as I drive. Our conversations were like those I have with my own daughters. I find myself wishing that I'd spoken with her more, reached out more often, or said something different. But to be honest with myself, I can't imagine what I could have said to make things any different!! I am so angry right now. But I don't know what else I could have done. I don't know what I am going to say or do when I see the parents. They have to go without their 25 year old daughter. I still have mine. Life is so unfair and I can't continue to see young people die like this. As much as I want to quit, I know I have so many people depending on me right now to help them with their journey. I need to get my motivation back.",

    "Content":"Let me just start off by saying that my now ex girlfriend\/baby mama (31F), and I (34M) are cocaine addicts. It has completely destroyed our lives.\n\nI've been using for about 4 years, and she has been using for about 12 years. The last 2 have been the worst of my life.\n\nI started to lose control when my grandma's (the woman that raised me) health started to decline severely. When she died 2 years ago, I went into a grief spiral, and completely nuked everything.\n\nThe following is what I've been through in just the last year alone:\n\n-5 pinks slips\n-3 job firings\n-2 break ups w\/ my baby mama (yesterday was the second time)\n-1 accidental cocaine overdose\n-1 fetty lace overdose\n-1 apartment eviction\n-2 inpatient rehabs\n-1 sober living (Got kicked out for relapsing)\n\nI'm so fucking tired of this shit. I hate it. So much. It has taken nearly everything from me. In the last 24 hours, it has cost me my job, and my relationship.\n\nShe was everything to me. I fought so fucking hard for her. Harder than I've ever fought for anyone, including myself. She was my person. My soulmate.\n\nThe drugs changed us both. It stole our attention away from everything that mattered. We were best friends, partners, and lovers.\n\nI have gotten better with my usage, but her's has gotten so much worse. It's taking her mental health to extremely dangerous places. We are both toxic individuals, and it's worse in our relationship. We both just keep triggering and enabling each other.\n\nI hope that one day we will get sober and healthy, and we'll have a chance to try again. Staying together now will only hurt or kill each other.\n\nI'm trying to focus on myself and my sons, but it's still fresh. If not being with me saves her life, then I will gladly sacrifice what I want. This is hard. She was the love of my life. The only woman that ever made me feel seen, heard, and understood. She made me feel unconditionally loved.\n\nI know I have to let her go to save us both, but I love her so fucking much. Things have to get better from here. This is my last chance to save myself.\n\nTL;DR Severe cocaine addiction has destroyed my family's lives, and everything just keeps getting worse. Feeling pretty done.",

    "Content":"long story short, im 21 years old, and have spent the last 6 years of my life completely alone for the most part, i have no social life, i was the lonely loser in highschool that would hide in the bathrooms to kill time. i didnt ever get female attention, really i would avoid them for the most part out of insecurity. i still live with my family, but being the oldest out of my siblings i really felt eager to get financially free asap, i started putting most my life savings in the stockmarket as soon as i turned 18 and i stayed disciplined up until i was 20, i would do a lot of unnecessary stuff to save money, and it payed off i suppose, at my peak last year i had 50k saved up in stock equity (most i ever had)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bvqf8xcedwqe1.jpg?width=861&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=396499b9fb45cdf2b2e47b2030dbf8c45bf10eac\n\nto add more context i was always addicted to porn, i had discovered it and frequently watched it in my middleschool years of my life and it went on until i was 20, then it started to get more severe, onlyfans starts spreading, its all that pops up on my feed now, so i give in, in total i probably spent like 4k-6k on OF i would rather not check but thats my closest guess. \n\neventually my 50k networth at 20 gets closer to like 35k at the end of last year, because i also did help my family with their credit card debt and my part of the bills for the year\n\nits now a week before valentines day in 2025 and im super sad one day for whatever reason i get the bright idea of finally losing my virginity to a hooker, i was already in the area, the first time i got scammed, the second time i finally lost my virginity! i felt a boost in ego, and wanted more immediately, in total my first week after finding where to go, i had already spent 2grand , i would tell myself stuff like, i wont let my account go lower than 30k, then it gets that low, now im saying 25k is my limit, it got so bad my 35k at the start of this year is now  only 12k as of today :(\n\n[all that i have left now](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b8xszqw6vwqe1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21b0930192f4142067dff7ccfb116756b4a4e7d7)\n\ni think the first 3 weeks of doing this it was the excitement of sex that kept me going but then i started to gain attachment with just one regular hooker, and i would say thats what really started to get me to spend irrational amounts certain nights, sometimes i wish i never met her, but sometimes i hate to see her go, so i pay extra to stay with her longer, my porn addiction essentially translated to a sex addiction i would always go crazy amounts of rounds for no reason, it didnt hit me that wasnt normal until one day she, a hooker, called me a sex addict that kinda made me think after that day.\n\n i still regularly go to her and like i said its not even about the sex at this point i enjoy her presence we usually hang out in between rounds just talking while we smoke or get something to eat, i still get anxious around her but just the ease of having someone engaged enough to make me feel noticed feels good, really good, i cant let it go, and i dont even want to try and replicate it with anyone else i know its unhealthy and im just stuck in a money pit by paying for sex and company but ive just lost all motivation in life i guess\n\nive tried to get myself to go SAA meetings havent yet successfully gone, ive tried to get myself to confess to my mom and other family i sort of trust but overall i just feel it will be used against me so i continue to hold off or just say everythings fine if they ask whats wrong. it doesnt help that im basically unemployed as well eventually i wont have enough to sustain this addiction, everytime i tell the regular i go to that i wanna take a break i relapse, now nothing really is fulfilling enough to change what i have going on yet i guess, i still have life goals and stuff i want to do so these kinda things have been driving me crazy i never thought id let myself get this low. knowing ill have to work a couple years to make old progress again doesnt sit right with me, i want to change, just dont know where to go for help and honestly i feel defeated",

    "Title":"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",
    "Content":"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nWe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [\/r\/SuicideWatch\/wiki\/incitement](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/wiki\/incitement). \n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[\/r\/SuicideWatch\/wiki\/incitement](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/wiki\/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###Summary###\n\n**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https:\/\/www.speakingofsuicide.com\/2015\/03\/03\/what-not-to-say\/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SuicideWatch\/comments\/25igd7\/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt\/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http:\/\/redd.it\/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http:\/\/redd.it\/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",

    "Content":"16, I turned 16 two days ago. It was a happy celebration, we reunited with a friend we thought we'd never see, we had a sleepover at an airbnb, it was fun. But I went home yesterday.. and we still met up today, me and my friends. After I got home, I still had fun.. until my dad asked me if I can lend him 2k php (\u224834 usd), I said no and lashed out, I told him I dont lend money to gamblers (my dad is a gambler).\n\nThen I took a nap, after that nap I woke up with my mother berating me, calling me disrespectful and that I should just give in. Mind you, I am 16 and my father is 40, 40! If anyone should give someone money, its him, he should give me money and not the other way around because I'm an unemployed 16 year old and hes a 40 year old with a successful business who spends all his profits on his fucking gambling addiction!\n\nThen I ranted to my mother about stuff (daughter of a gambling addict, my self harm scars, how people at my school gossiped about my family, my friends openly seeing my father gamble all his money away, how I wish i was never born, etc.) i thought the woman would sympathize with me, but no! She condemned my fathers actions, yes, but she called me out and said that its all my fault, she called me a user, someone who only goes to people for money! My mother said I'm an ungrateful piece of shit who uses people for my own benefit when I do not! I reach out to people for my needs, needs that theyre unable to provide, my tuition, my allowance thats all provided by my grandparents who should be retired but still arent! (The grandparents in question are my moms parents since my fathers parents are pretty much useless gambling addicts\/con artists)\n\nI reached out to my friends after all that, i admitted that I cut myself, that I want to kill myself.. and being the angels that they are, they comforted me and listened. They're the only people I live for, why I choose to continue living, I dont want to hurt my people, my friends, because theyre my family. \n\nDespite all that, I still want to kill myself, be it through starving, bleeding to death, or overdosing on laxatives until I die.\n\nThanks for reading this awfully long rant, appreciate it if you read until here\n\nEdit: I made it more clearer; mother did condemn my fathers gambling addiction but she just lets it be.. so in a way, shes kind of justifying it",

    "Content":"[21F] Hello everyone. I need to vent, and I have no one to vent to, I wish I could get some support, but I know this post will get ignored like most of mine do because nobody cares about me. \n\nI haven't gone outside in God knows how long, and if I have it's been for a very short while, a couple hours at most. I haven't gone to school almost the entire year, and I'm in my final year of university, I'm probably not graduating. My mother will be very disappointed in me and I don't even want to think about how she'll abuse me when she finds out I'm likely not gonna finish university after she helped pay some of my tuition. I have no motivation to go to school, I haven't had any since I enrolled, and over the last three years I've been in school I've tried to motivate myself without success. Each year I just had less and less attendance. I don't want to learn anything, I feel exhausted and drained, I don't like any field, I'm not interested in any careers, and unfortunately if I want a job with a liveable wage in my country I not only need my bachelors degree but I should also complete masters. I can't take a break because I know I won't start again if I do, plus, I would need to get a job, because my mother isn't going to let me sit and do nothing. I can't motivate myself to get out of bed and go to school, let alone work a shitty job that's probably not even gonna pay well. \n\nI am very lonely, and it hurts so bad, that only fuels my isolation, because I have nothing to go outside for. I hate strangers, I hate crowded places and I don't want to hang out places with less people because I am a woman and scared for my safety, the only reason I would have to go outside would be friends or a partner, and I have neither. Before you go and say that \"of course you don't have a social circle if you never go outside!\" I've been outside my entire damn life and I still never made any friends. I've been to school, places people my age hang out, extracurricular activities etc. over the years yet I haven't ever had real or proper friends, why would it be any different now? \n\nI'm also incredibly unattractive, I'm fat and ugly and while theoretically I could fix the fat part in practice I can't without slipping back into ED territory like every time I tried to lose weight over the years, the thought of dieting again is extremely distressing and triggering for me. I'm also weird as fuck and have an unappealing personality because I'm autistic on top of everything so I can't even attract someone with that. Although even if I had a great personality people wouldn't give a shit because the outside is repulsing. \n\nI feel so useless and hopeless, I wish I could just die somehow, I've tried numerous times over the years to commit suicide yet I've always been unsuccessful because I've always been too much of a pussy to do it properly. I've been self-harming for a long time now just to cope with it all. I'm too scared to try to commit again, because what if something good is waiting for me? Then again, I couldn't possibly regret it, because I'd be dead. I don't see any other way out of my pain and anguish other than death, I've tried so hard for so long to get better and nothing works, I've only gotten worse.\n",

I don\u2019t blame my cousin I love her dearly. \n\nThe thing is all these memories came back and first it was what happened to me, then little by little memories that I may have perpetuated other cousin is coming to me to. There like flashbacks and then it ends \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22\n\nIm promise you on my soul, I wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. The issue is, it\u2019s driving me crazy and it doesn\u2019t help with my ocd. My brain feels on fire, this spiral started last year and hasn\u2019t stop since. My brain hurts so bad.\n\nThe issue is, I was looking if anyone has similar experiences to me on TikTok, I can\u2019t afford therapy so I looked.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m even worse \ud83d\ude22\n\nLet\u2019s just say, people are making videos and leaving comments saying people you committed deserve death. I\u2019ve seen post saying they don\u2019t care if the other person was raped or sa. \n\nI was taught the behavior, it was taught as a game \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nI\u2019m not saying or excusing the behavior but seeing people saying people you did that should die is really making me feel I should off my dirty self.\n\nMy memories are so foggy, me and my cousins are all still close but I have this fear if the memory are coming back for me what is coming back for them. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a few post say that you can be charged for something you did as a kid.\n\nI\u2019m scared, I a good person I swear \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen a few post on Reddit talking about calling cps on people who committed cocsa so they can get there kids taken away. Since most are adults not and moved on with there life, cocsa victims are wanting to call cps to remove there kids. \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI know social is a great place to express Yourself and I\u2019m not saying they shouldn\u2019t say there stories. What I\u2019m saying is cocsa is such a complex scary situation. I didn\u2019t even know what this was till last year , I didn\u2019t know there was a name for it. \n\nYes I got perpetrated 3 times by other kids and I really didn\u2019t know it was wrong I just let it happen. It wasn\u2019t until I was 10 and this voice in my head was like ( this is wrong ) I was last perpetrated at age 11 and this time I froze for the first time. As I said I do forgive every single one, they all have great lives and all I want if for healing for everyone. I wish as children we were al protected.\n\nAs for me I can\u2019t forgive myself \ud83d\ude22 Idk if I did it but as the memories one back it\u2019s definitely leaning towards I did. Early childhood sexual exposure as definitely affected my life greatly. It lead to a porn addiction and becoming deadly suicidal.\n\nI\u2019m suffering from many forms of ocd and each day a new memory comes and a new thought I stress about. Right now I\u2019m dealing with pocd. I feel like a pedo \ud83d\ude2d because I feel I hurt people. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, im just scared everyone going to come for me one day and idk. Last night I really thought how better it be if I was gone.\n\nIm afraid to date because what guy would want to date a girl with this past.\n\nAfter realizing I was using porn to cope with what I went through, legit after quitting that\u2019s when all the memories were triggered \ud83d\ude22\n\nDo I deserve death, am I a abuser \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 these keep eating at my so. \n\nWill I be able to ever live a normal life \ud83d\ude2d I fear I won\u2019t. I fear someone posting me for something I don\u2019t remember or did and didn\u2019t know was wrong at the time. \n\nWould you date someone with this passed? Would you avoid them? I legit feel dirty, I keep showering multiple times a day to get rid of this feelings. But I still feel dirty. \n\nI\u2019m still a virgin because my sa wasn\u2019t full on sex, I fear sex. I close my legs tight because fear of contact. But now look, I could\u2019ve caused this to someone else \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI feel like a monster, because of what I was taught. I done way more things as a coping mechanism \ud83d\ude2d I wish to say it all but I\u2019m tired, my soul my literal soul is tired.\n\nI see people say all the time, it doesn\u2019t matter if they were a kid\ud83d\ude22\n\nIdk what to do, I remember even on time when I was googling years ago about stories like mine. I was still a minor. And I came across a website of people\u2019s talking about sa\/incest. I was radish different stories but realized these were much more graphic then mine. Some of the people were acting like what had happened wasn\u2019t wrong. The issue is while reading this I felt a weird sensation in my body \ud83d\ude2d my pantys were wet,  I feel so ashamed saying this. Because I did read that to get aroused or anything. Even though I experienced sa, I still didn\u2019t know about sex or arousal so when that happened I was confused. Some people told me this happens to aa victims because the brain and body can\u2019t tell the difference sometimes \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThen another time at age 5 i walked up to my dog fully clothed and place there face on my private he moved his face away quickly. I guess I didn\u2019t understand what I was doing, but this ass started because I was being shown sexual behaviors as young as 3. I remember feeling like I might get in trouble but this memories changes on me 24\/7 and idk if my mind is messing with me.\n\nI apologize saying this all. I know I\u2019m gross, I know I\u2019m nasty. I just feel dead inside. \n\nAnd I wonder if death is better for me. \n\n",

But I also wanted to give it one last try, give my dreams one last chance before I burn it all, like one last dive before embracing the depths of the ocean.\n\nSo I decided to apply everywhere, everywhere I humanly could. Targetted upper, mid and lower tier grad schools, meticulously planned all my applications, managed to apply to 7 schools while working 13 hours a day and pursuing part time grad school for 4 hours a day, 6 days a week.

I have been rejected from everywhere. I want to die. Not because I'm struggling with failure, by now I had already expected that and was kind of ready. I know for a fact that my A plan never works. and this time around my B plan can keep me fed but it can't keep me happy nor alive.\n\nAnd I refuse to live a life that is not of my choosing, i cannot continue this rat race, I don't find it worth the hassle of life.\n\nSo i'll plan it now\n\nMy end game\n\nBut I want to plan it in a way that it seems natural, and my parents don't blame themselves, and my family doesn't lose face in society ( in my country and religion, suicide is considered and offense against God, and is not permissible no matter the circumstances, and I love my family, I want to protect them even after I'm gone) I want to go with dignity, without the label of a suicidal person.\n\nCan that happen?\n\nIs it too much to ask?\n\nLike most of my dreams and ambitions?\n\nAm I condemned to this living hell?\n\nI cannot choose the way I live, can I not even choose the way I die?\n\nCan God not grant me this one wish?",

    "Content":"In 2020 the only person I've ever felt a real connection with died by suicide. I was 18 at the time, she had just turned 20. It wasn't a big surprise, yet I had never even imagined it would actually happen. I tried so hard to be there for her and she relied on me so much. She had a million reasons to do it and I don't blame her at all. It wasn't her first attempt, she had many before. Nearly 5 years later and I still can't bear the weight of it. Time was supposed to heal my wounds, but I've been feeling worse than ever and nothing has helped. I can't function anymore, my thoughts always go back to her and how much I miss her. I'd do anything to see her again. Even if I won't see her again when I die at least I won't have to endure her absence any longer.\n\nI've never loved another person since her. I don't think I'll ever be able to.\n\nIt hurts so fucking much to talk about her with anyone. Nobody in my life knew her very well, it feels like I'm the only one who cared about her. Her family kind of sucked and I haven't spoke to them since before she died. I feel so bad and awkward to bring her up because it's been so long and I'm ashamed to still feel like this. I miss her more than ever. I don't want anything out of life anymore. I've made a lot of effort to build myself up in the past few years but everything fell apart and none of the effort feels worthwhile. I don't see a way out, she will always be a memory and it hurts too much. I need to be with her again, and there's only one way that can happen. I live in a high-rise apartment building and the temptation to jump is overwhelming. When she died I promised her I'd carry on and cherish the memories we had together while still trying to live, but I can't do it anymore. I don't want to traumatize my family either, I know how bad it feels to lose someone to suicide and it's the only real deterrent I have. But this pain is unbearable. I can't exist anymore. I just want to relive those two years on repeat forever, I don't want to be here for another 40-50+ years with her being a fading memory.",

I feel as if I was lying to everyone, saying stuff like \"yess I am going to marry my boyfriend once we are both stable!\" or \"I am starting my career as a voice actress, isn't it amazing?!?\". But I just can't stop. Of course I want to be happy. I want to marry my boyfriend, who is my soulmate, I want to wake up everyday caressing and making delicious breakfast to see him smile. But I know this is temporary. I am just giving myself my last hopes. \nNo matter how much I try, how much I love.. The end has been decided. That's what hurts the most. Knowing that I am just buying time, pretending that I will make it to Summer.  Making my father who kind of abuses me (he just hits me or chokes me when I misbehave) mad because of how much money I will make him lose when I am dead makes me really anxious because I don't want him to get mad at me.\n\nSorry for not structuring this text correctly. I am mentally in the worst place I have ever been, English is not my main language and I am pretty slow minded. I tried to get help but my psychologist got me an appointment for may 5th. May 5th!!!! how do they think I will not be dead by then? This is ridiculous, they had person who openly said in a hospital that she wants to kill herself and the hospital gives me a date so far?? Is this a joke?\n\nAnyway. I want to get better. I really do. But I just know I will end up killing myself, it's not a thing I want to do, it's something I will eventually do.\nI feel like a liar.\nI just want to be happy.\nI have no friends and my boyfriend is also bad mentally so he asked for space so he can get better and then get married.\nThe only person I'm around all day is my father who makes me feel ever worse. He almost hit me today because it seems that my way of saying yes to him offended him. I just didn't say yes clearly because I was just woken up in a bad way.\nHe told me I would be on the street by the next thing I do. Because he wants to live happily with his girlfriend and stepdaughter.\nI hope he killed me one day while he was choking me or something.\n\nI keep thinking about killing myself tomorrow because tomorrow is the last time we see eachother in months. He is my only light, the only one who makes me smile and laugh. I used to have hobbies, I loved drawing, and playing GTA4. I had a comic planned but I just can't draw. I have no passion for anything. I fear my boyfriend cancelling the date because of any reason. I will definitely try to do something I don't really want to do",

    "Content":"Hello. I'm Hajun. I'm 13, and about a month ago I came into highschool. I would like to clarify that I'm a big overthinker. I stress a lot, get bugged and annoyed at the slightest thing. Why am I like this. \n\nEver since highschool started, everything has gone downhill. I've been told it's \"easy\" or \"similar\" to primary school. It's not. I've lost some of my friends, or am losing them. I hate schoolwork or anything related to it. I hate anything really. Hell, I got a D on my latest science CAT. What if this continues? Then my parents will become what they always are.\n\nObviously, my parents are the main reason I hate life. They abuse me. Not as severe as others, but enough to make me cry and hate myself. Mental, verbal and physical. What will they do about me if I tell them about my problems? Nothing. Judge me. Tell me to study more? It doesn't help I have 2 older sisters that both have gotten into a decent university and have been the straight A kids. Now my parents expect me to be like them.\n\nThis is really turning into a rant, but dude. It actually fucking pisses me off whenever they say something like \"why aren't you like your sister\" or really anything related to me being like them. I don't like sport. I don't play it much. My sisters did. Now my parents are asking me why I'm not like them.\n\nSorry but do fucking personality traits not differ to everyone?\n\nBack on topic. School is wrecking me. Home is wrecking me. My mum took my phone away an hour ago, which Isn't that bad. To be fair I would sleep late. But she **has** to know my password. I change my password everytime I tell her it, because if I choose not to, she has to KEEP FUCKING PUSHING ME ON TO GET IT\n\nSORRY DOES PRIVACY NOT EXIST IN YOUR WORLD? I'M NOT DOING RISKY SHIT! I'M NOT VAPING SMOKING DRINKING BEING AN ESHAY BEING A WEIRDO! EVERYTIME SHE TAKES IT, SHE HAS TO MEMORISE IT\n\nLast time she had my phone, I caught her looking through my camera roll. What the actual fuck.\n\nI can't do this. It feels selfish to want to commit suicide. There are people out there with worse problems, and here I am, literally only sad when I have these thoughts.\n\nI've tried helplines, they don't help at all.\n\nSomeone give me some advice. Please.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n",

I'm 17, depressed, barely even able to get out of bed sometimes, and I'm so traumatized from things that happened to me throughout my adolescence that I barely function outside of zombie-like living conditions. I make roughly $11 an hour and I barely work anyways because I want to kill myself so bad that I can't even bring myself to eat or move and so I only work 2-3 days a week after school.

    "Title":"I have no self worth",
    "Content":"I (19M) have no self worth\n\nI started university last year and am now wrapping up this year. For the past 7 months I don't know what I did. I have no friends, I haven't talked to a single girl. I haven't done anything but eat, sleep, and study.\n\nI've been crying myself to sleep every other night because of how lonely it feels. I even stopped attending lectures halfway through and just went for labs because I couldn't handle seeing everyone else around me in their own relationships and friend groups. \n\nLet me give you some backstory. Skip to the bottom if you'd like, these are just a mad man's rambles.\n\nIt's not like my school life was any different. I didn't really make any friends growing up. And I didn't manage to have a social life at all. Every year I'd try and make friends and join the social group forming in the class I was in but after a month or so I'd be back where I started. I don't know why people were so repulsed by me, I don't know why I wasn't able to integrate. And every year at the end I'd hate everyone and everything and convince myself I was being bullied so my parents would transfer me to another school. I did that 10 times till highschool where I had to stay. \n\nInstead of playing soccer or befriending people at recess I'd just sit with my head in a book or sit alone. I don't know why young me did that, I don't remember liking it but it gave me a sense of validation since I got better grades than people. And since my grades were better my parents would encourage me. When I got to puberty and started really really caring about making friends and relationships I hated sitting alone but it was all I could do. At the end of highschool I got out with valedictorian, but I had a massive fight with my parents since I didn't want to attend the graduation ceremony in the first place. They forced me to but I didn't attend the senior walk or any of the other school events. And of course, I wasn't invited to prom.\n\nAnd as for relationships, I've had none. Maybe I've had a few friends but I've never been able to talk to girls. After puberty this started hitting me hard so I told myself I'd try and be a person and that I'd change, I started going to the gym, I got in shape, I tried going out and meeting people, but I'd never be able to turn those into anything. Anyone I met treated me like a stranger the following day. \n\nThe first girl I ever managed to talk to was during covid, she was in my class and we started texting and even flirted a bit. I didn't have the social skills to talk to her in real life so it stayed that way, we stayed in an online relationship... for all of two weeks until she found someone with an ounce of social skills to talk to.\n\nLater, I remember these two girls who I met and tried to hold a conversation with (only amicably), failing, of course, then later having their friend come up to me in a group to very bluntly tell me they found me creepy and that I made them uncomfortable. I immediately apologized and said I didn't mean to and all the usual shit and she just walked away. I wrote a suicide note when I got home that day. You know the worst part about that day is I had a friend with me who was actually trying to pick one of them up, but the girls apparently didn't care to mention his name, only mine. I still blame myself for that and I don't know what I did wrong. \n\nAnother time I was on a student exchange trip I managed to befriend a girl there. oNe night she got drunk and started making out with me, she wanted to go further and I tried saying something romantic but instead I said something autistic that turned her off and I haven't heard from her since.\n\nMore recently my own mother getting concerned introduced me to a daughter of one of her friends and got us into a private tutoring lesson together for the high school exams last year. This time I couldn't even muster up the courage to look her in the eye that often. I tried, I really did, I tried talking to her and even one time when my mother took me out with her and her friend we held a semi-bad conversation. But I just couldn't, and by the end I couldn't even bring myself to greet her before the tutor came.\n\nAs for friends I really did also try to change myself in highschool. I went out with some people, people I honestly shouldn't have but I was just so lonely. There was this one guy who'd keep talking about gossip in the class and then would make a joke about how I wouldn't know about it or wasn't involved. And of course you know, gossip is 95% of what people talk about so even with the people who were good to me it still hurt to listen to them talk about it knowing I could never be part of it or enter that social world. Hell there's one time a friend talked to me about their \"love life\" and how they couldn't find someone they were \"compatible\" with and all I could think about was the COD ghost meme.\n\nAnd I legitimately have no social skills. I don't know a better way to phrase it, but I can't function normally. I get shy as hell going to the cashier. I can barely navigate public transit without having an anxiety attack. I have no clue how to act in a confrontation, or how to negotiate for anything, or any of the most basic life skills. I say the wrong shit in the wrong places all the time. I talk inappropriately to adults sometimes, wirh people of my own generation I come off as clueless and childish or at best weird. I don't pick up on most social cues or signals no matter how much I try. I'm horrifically unobservant, it's a miracle I can even drive.\n\nYou can skip down to here to get past the rambles of the mad man.\n\nAll that backstory is to say I really wanted university to be different. I hyped myself up, I started going to the gym again, I told myself that I'd finally have friends for a change. I'd learn the social skills that I desperately needed. I wouldn't be so shy and I'd stop getting anxiety attacks the moment I stepped anywhere in public. And who knows? Maybe I'd finally meet a girl and be able to talk to her. But no, it looks like I just clowned myself...\n\nWhen I do try going to university, and try meeting people, as I did early on, I realized something. Any ounce of confidence I've had in myself has long been destroyed. I can't bring myself to approach anyone or talk to anyone. I feel bad for anyone that talks to me or befriends me because I feel like I'm wasting their time when they otherwise could be meeting someone who's actually competent. And they'll realize what I am very soon so it's not like they'll care or like me anyways. I'm always in my head, I can't escape the feeling like I keep fucking up and even mostly positive social interactions I later start to notice the weird shit that I said, the social cues that I missed, anything. I can't escape my head and I don't know what to do.\n\nI feel like a fucking failure of a creature. I feel like a disappoint everyone everyday. My own mother doesn't trust me for the most basic shit. Hell to even go out with me driving she has to snort 15 nicotine packets. And the worst part about it is I'm so fucking lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to and I just want to feel loved. I want to feel like a normal person, be able to interact like normal people, be part of the social world. I want to have a love life. What the fuck did I do wrong to be deprived of these basic parts of being human? At the every least I just want to know what I fucked up \n\nAnd the even worse thing is that I know shit won't change. I'm stuck in the university I'm in with virtually the same schedule and routine for the next 5-7 years. And I have no guarantee it'll get better even after that.\n\nI had a friend in high school who I'd talked to about this and he'd reassure me and say that he's met lots of people like me and they always figure it out somehow and it works out.\n\nI don't think it's going to work out. I don't think it's going to get better, and I'm really on the edge here. I've tried to fix shit for so long, I really really have tried. How do I get of my head? Is there a way besides killing myself, because I don't know anymore...\n\n\n\n",

I have no real purpose for living in this shit fucking society we are forced to partake in.

Figure that one out. \n\nI'm quiting therapy as it is doing really nothing significant and is a waste of my time and money. \n\nI also feel my meds have made me go crazy so I'm gonna quit those.\n\nSo many times recently, I have come close to ending it all. But I can't bring my self to do it. I don't get it. I hate my life, but I guess I'm afraid of what may or not be on the other side of this life. \n\nBut I get the feeling I won't be missed. At all. So why won't I just pull that fucking trigger and blow my brains out already?\n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if no one responds to this. Just like no one acknowledges me in real life. I don't exist to others, apparently.",

    "Content":"TW: MENTIONS OF S3LF H@RM \n\nso l've never had any experience with therapy\nand this was my first time contacting a\npsychologist. it was an online session and she\ntook the payment before the session started\n\ni started off with saying that I have concentration issues and that I have suicidal thoughts. she then proceeded to ask me about my childhood, my family, financial condition and some questions about what made me feel neglected and all. she asked me about my education and what I wanna do in the future and it led to me talking about how my father has been investing in my education. she started talking about how most fathers in my country don't usually do this for their children and hence he apparently loves me very dearly.\n\nNow what made me feel deeply judged and\nkinda uneasy is that she kept telling me how\nmy dad loves me dearly even though most of\nmy issues are because of my dad himself. she\nsaid it almost 4-5 times (note: I didn't mention\nmuch or rather didn't get a chance to discuss\nwhat he does that bothers me and ended up\njust talking about his devotion towards my\neducation mostly).\n\nshe also told me how I have nothing much going on in my life to be \"this level of\ndepressed.\"' She also proceeded to laugh after\nI said that l've always wanted to dissapear\nsince my childhood but in a painless way (I also mentioned that now I became less scared of going through pain as i continued to grow). She then told me with a smile \"See if you sl!t your wrist, jump from a building or try any other way of k!ll!ng yourself, then it's bound to hurt and hence a stupid thought and a stupid act. More over if your attempt fails then you'll have to go through major embarassment and that's why it's all stupid to do something like that\"\n\nThis kinda ticked me off because l've always\nheard about not saying something as\ndismissive as this to a suicidal person but\nthen again I'm not a doctor so who knows. I\nalso mentioned about me not being able to\nconcentrate and she didn't pay much attention\nto that. she just talked mostly about my\nchildhood and my depression and suicidal\nthoughts. She gave me few assignments to do\nlike walking regularly, physical excercise,\njournaling and separating rice from pulses\nafter mixing then together for helping me with\nconcentration.\n\ni just want to know if this is an okay thing for a\ntherapy session and whether or not i need to\nchange my doctor. Though this was our first session. She asked me to see her again after 10-15 days after I've done all the assignments she gave me. \n\ni posted this in a therapy subreddit as well since I want advice. ",

People who don't run away from me and live as myself are truly amazing and happy people.\nYou, and I have such a strong desire to escape (run away), so instead of living, I try to escape by committing suicide.

    "Title":"I just walked out of the hospital",
    "Content":"\nI'm not sure if this is lost or suicide note but either way I needed to say it. using a throwaway account. Everything is coming to an end one way or another but I've been admitted to hospital, on my own with no one to visit me or be with and I can't take it anymore so I took what pills I could, and walked out. I'm not sure how many tablets if taken I've lost count. but I don't want to anymore. everyone is better off without me. this is how and why;. if it reads strange it's because I removed some personal details of people I've mentioned.\n\nEveryone in my immediate family, worst of all are my brothers (physically abused me severely for all the years until he got married) and sisters (especially R who is unfit to be a mother, has physically and psychologically harmed me for as long as I can remember, to present day. M another sister has also robbed me and continues to harass me). \nThese people use the excuse of our father's abuse as the reason they have tormented me my whole life (and continue to) however I was also subject to his abuse as well as my mother who as she aged has tried to stop the cycle of abuse. I'm still and always was everyone's punching bag. they never cared about me and I hope to God they are punished in this life and hereafter because I do not and will not forgive my siblings for how they have caused so much pain, physically and mentally. If being beaten regularly wasn't enough it was my siblings that made me homeless, lied to social services and police, and prevented me from going to university as a means of control. One social services visit was made after being referred from CAMHS, in which they did not believe me. this is when the abuse got worse as 'punishment\n'. All my siblings are older than me and knew that the house my parents were sending me to was owned by a pedophile and his wife, yet they never stopped my parents from sending me there. J, my brothers wife, was someone who also prevented justice being served as she refused to come forward to police despite knowing what the predator was. Their son, is unsafe in their or his maternal grandmothers care, as there is video evidence of the family in Turkey with a Turkish ice cream man poking his genitals with a metal rod, which his parents thought was 'funny'. They and his mother's sister regularly blackmail and torment him, and it kills me knowing he is unsafe and around strange individuals like his distant 'uncle' A, who has just migrated to the country. Both of my nephews are at risk of abuse and the only trusted person for both of them is my mother, but just barely as she cannot speak English& a victim of severe domestic abuse and therefore is unable to speak up for herself. My mother is the one person I forgive in what she has done to me and I hope she forgives me too. My nephews and my mother are the only 3 people in this awful world that I love dearly and it pains me to do this and leave them but I have no other choice. \n\n\nAges 8 to 11 I was severely molested, by the predator that my family sent me to. the lead investigator on the case is CK of the police. After several years of first reporting, the predator and his accomplice (his wife, who sends children to him) are still free, unpunished, and still charging money from unknowing parents and guardians of children sent to their house to learn the Qur'an, and it is under this guise that they are assaulting children, like me and before I was assaulted and continues to occur. I know this from the things other victims have told me (like TG of). Yet he has gone unpunished, despite rumors of his abuse, and victims like me coming forward. There is fear mongering amongst the local community as he is beloved to conduct 'black magic', and it's collectively believed this is the reason he goes 'free'. What happened to me has ruined my life with C-PTSD being the reality that has led me to this decision. This was not a choice but my only option. My faith has been stolen from me, unable to pray, yet alone every single one of the usual PTSD symptoms that control my life daily. \n\n2012 to 2018 from ages 11 to 18, I have had more of my life stolen from me from the ongoing side effects of what people such as: Abbie Ganger, Lilliana horvathrova, Ellie Davis, Muskan Khalid, Usman Hussain, Tayib, Hassan Bhutta, and Nicole Bradford, have done to me. For years I endured their abuse to the point I would skip school just to avoid their harassment, bullying, and abuse. They are named because they deserve to live with what they did to me, as I've lived with it the last 12yrs. Maybe if my death means anything to anyone, someone in a position of authority can inform them of the consequences of what they did to me for so long. To this day I still get flashbacks, nightmares and night terrors of them as well as the domestic violence, molestation, physical and sexual abuse and rape. While I was already dealing with severe mental health issues due to the domestic violence at home and being sexually assaulted at 'mosque', I couldn't find refuge at school either. I deserve justice, even that is as little as these individuals being informed of their place in my suicide note. Ms Ram of JLA was a staff member who verbally and physically assaulted me, saying awful things, forcing me to take off my trousers in front of her and abusing her role as attendance officer. Those my age are also aware of her daughter's sexually abusive relationship(s) with children who were students at the time of the abuse. Marie DeRome was safeguarding staff during this time and had failed to aid me in this time or signpost me to support. The only teacher that supported me and meant well was Mrs JM and I hope some day she knows that her support meant the world at the time. Because of the assault shortly after I finished my exams, I was never able to email her to thank her. \nAge 18, June 2019 I was r@ped for the first time by a Pakistani man named Alayon from West Bromwich. Age 21 while living alone WHG knowingly placed me in a racist area in which after of less than a year living there I was a victim of a racially motivated hate crime. This incident was reported to West midlands police but no action was ever taken. It is unsurprising given that in a racist area, that the police also had a bias (at least in this particular incident) and the individual responsible did not take what happened to me seriously. Now at 24, in January of 2025 I was raped again with the lead investigator HW on the case. She, and her colleague, whom I had made a formal complaint against (in which nothing was done, no further action was ever taken thanks to the broke policies and procedures of west midlands police). The only police who have done me right were the two male police officers who I spent the whole day with and took me to the SARC centre. this was the only time, in the longest time that I can remember and of almost 25 years of life that I felt safe, even if just for a day. while I was in shock from being raped I still felt the alien feeling of being safe, even if just once in my conscious memory. Thank you for looking out for me, and for feeling the anger that I wish my family and siblings should have felt for me but never did. I hope that they are praised and rewarded because it meant the world to me that two strangers looked out for me more than any other police officer, social worker, doctor, counsellor, or family member. \nI have been open to mental health services since the age of 13, where being in CAMHS was one of my first introductions to systematic failure. From my first appointment where they illegally broke confidentiality to having awful things said to me during counselling as a child, FUCK CAMHS. there was no support as I aged out of the service, no urgency in any diagnosis, medication, or therapy, even after overdosing in early 2015 as a 14yr old child. \nAs of now, I have been on the waiting list for psychological therapies (Dorothy pattissons) for 5years now. the average waiting time is 2-3years. For some reason, there was something about me that caused them to skip over me and my treatment. one letter was sent out, after I was made homeless due to the hate crime, I was never able to retrieve my post given that the area was racist. instead of emailing or calling me and despite amending my contact details there was no effort on black country healthcare and DP hospital to reach out to me and thus resulted in me being skipped over in my treatment. By medical standards there should be at least 2 attempts made in contacting me and this was never done. because of my complext trauma I was rejected from talking therapies and primary mental healthcare, being told verbally and in writing that my 'needs are too severe'. psychological therapies is the only service in my catchment area\/county that could have helped me but ___________________ are the only 2 individuals on the scheme. There needs to be at least some accountability for my mistreatment that I should have received years ago. Drs Gloria only made a referral after reminding her that what she said was disgusting. dr_________ was the psychiatric doctor on the ward and present for my exit interview from being an inpatient at DP hospital, in which she said in a room full of doctors and nurses that she 'cant help' me because I 'feel this way due to the things that happened (to me)'. not one person intervened or stood up for me as she smiled in my face telling me this while I was there for being so suicidal that I was not able to be at home. she is still practicing at DP hospital, and should be held accountable for her role in my mistreatment. There was also staff on the home treatment team such as Zippora who left me hopeless in my time of need. Both then and in 2025, after recently being seen by her at DP hospital. she is just as unsuitable and inept at her job today as she was then. \n\nNow there is no support for the level of trauma I have suffered. the nearest Rape crisis services officially are in Coventry. both them and birmingham rape crisis services are not open to me as I live in a small town. Horizon was the specialized service for here but is officially and permanently closed. that leaves me with nothing. no talking therapies, no primary care, no psychological therapies hub, nothing. Black country womens aid offers just 2 rounds of counselling which I have exhausted prior to the second rape that happened. so for some reason im not allowed that again despite a second assault. but it isn't their fault that there are so many victims with black country womens aid being their only means for support. The NHS in the county that I was born and live in has been unable to give me the treatment I've so desperately needed and have been begging for the last 10 years. Black country healthcare is the organisation that I've been dying in front of with no care to try and help me. I've been pleading for help for so long that I sincerely agree to any help that I can get, but still I've been failed repeatedly by staff, authority figures, the local NHS services and West midlands police. This note is the last thing I'll post or say",

Im tired of smiling and acting like im okay when i have nothing in my eyes. im tired of continuing a life that i dont want. tired of society and everything else i cant think of. \n\nmaybe im not really so mentally fucked up. maybe im just overreacting. maybe i could just talk about all this to someone but no on really knows a single thing about how i feel and in my situation is there any possibility will talking to someone i know will help.\n\nyes, I know there are so many good things to look forward in life and things and some people I do genuinely love and care for. I love my pets, my siblings, family, my friends, hobbies and interests which are maybe the only things that are keeping me here right now. whats giving me hope and the tiniest bits of courage to try to see a future id be willing to live in or to continue living this farce.\n\nbut everything really just hurts and i feel like shit everyday. im a bad person if you really knew me. i think logically but act ignorant in so many situations im useless i feel like a humiliation. if i continue to live i'll just become some mentally ill dissapointment to everyone in my life and to society. i dont really have the guts to kill myself. i think suicide would just worsen things for the people I actually do love. so i just beg for someone to kill me or maybe just me dying in my sleep. im trying to even just live but i dont know for how long anymore. idrk what to do with life",

    "Title":"My (23f) cousin (21M) is suicidal and I don\u2019t know how to help",
    "Content":"This post is about my younger cousin Tom (21M). We grew up together as neighbours\/cousins and were really close. During puberty he distanced himself and now I don\u2019t really have any contact to him anymore. \n\nDuring Highschool he started to be really into gaming. After finishing high school he didn\u2019t really do anything else except gaming until his parents forced him to either go to uni or trade school. He decided to go to uni about 1 hour away from our home town. He started his bachelors in computer science but never even finished the first semester. From what I heard he got addicted to video games and became severely depressed. He visits his family maybe 3 times a year ( they are very religious and can be pretty suffocating in my opinion). \n\nSo his mom became increasingly worried about his mental state. She got my mom to get addresses of therapists etc (my mom is friends with one). But Tom didn\u2019t use any of them. Last August we had a wedding in our family and Tom\u2019s mom asked me if I could talk to Tom since I\u2019m the only one in the family who has been to therapy (anxiety disorder). I spent the whole wedding talking to him (we are both introverted and enjoy to be alone more than included in a bigger party). From what I gathered during the talk he does seem to know that his gaming is a big issue and drives him deeper into his depression. But he also said it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s still giving him a reason to get up so he isn\u2019t ready to give it up (plus his online friends are like 90% of his social contacts) \n\nIn August he didnt make the impression for me that he is ready to go to therapy but I did try to take away his concerns about therapy. It felt like logically he knew that he has a problem but not enough to wanting to change it seriously. I did over him to come stay with me for a bit (I live 6 hours away from our home town and I don\u2019t have a computer etc so he would be forced to focus on other stuff. I\u2019m also a ubiquitous student but I have a pretty strict course with a lot of routine and I thought it would maybe help him going along with that for a few weeks). His response was \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d. So I just told him the over stands and left it at that. \n\nNow my parents approached me and told me that Tom is apparently suicidal now (haven\u2019t seen him since August so I don\u2019t know). They asked me to approach him again. And obviously I want to help but I don\u2019t know how. His parents don\u2019t seem open to maybe get him into a psychiatric facility. I don\u2019t know where he lives right now and he never answers calls. So texting is the only chance I really got ( he rarely answers but he does seem to read it). \n\nSo my question is: does any have an idea how I should approach this? I\u2019m going back to uni on Sunday and I would over him to come with me again although I don\u2019t think he would. But I also don\u2019t want to just not try. I don\u2019t want to be to pushy as to not push him away. I also don\u2019t want to be too soft so he takes it seriously. ",

I just wanted to say that it's getting harder to stay here every day, especially when there's nothing really keeping me here. i guess my mom, maybe. sometimes i feel like she's just as lonely as i am. i wish i had siblings so they could take care of her after i\u2019m gone. but it's just me, and i have to deal with that.\n\ni've thought about numbing myself with medications just to feel a little better. the thought crosses my mind a lot, but i\u2019m scared of getting addicted\u2014like i did with self-harm\u2014so instead, i bought a coloring book to pass the time.

I'm so fucking disgusted and disappointed that I can't cope like most people do.  There's no way back up. It's like I'll never allow myself a chance to be happy the inner me would never allow it.

    "Content":"I was dismissed from nursing school due to an error I committed during clinicals. If you want more details you can check out my profile for the post I made about it. \n\nI have been trying to get back into nursing. I completed this allied health program, and started looking for nursing schools again. No public university or community college will accept dismissed students. I found a college that admits students that were dismissed for academic reasons only. I\u2019ve been looking at private colleges and they are extremely expensive, and honestly a scam based on reviews. \n\nSo many people cheered me on and gave me false hope, and I am just realizing that there is no way for me to fix this. I fucked up my future and there\u2019s no way around it. I am once again in one of my slumps, but it\u2019s different this time in so many ways. For example, I\u2019ve always had suicidal thoughts but this time they\u2019re truly lethal. I got the random thought that I could immolate myself and it hasn\u2019t quite left my brain since. I truly do feel hopeless and I don\u2019t see life getting better. I genuinely believe that I was just born screwed from the beginning. I never had a chance at life. Throughout the years everything has been building up and I think that I am finally at the point where all I need is a little push for me to finally let go. I don\u2019t know what that push will be or when I\u2019ll get that little push but I think it\u2019ll happen one way or another in the near future. Hopefully, cause I can\u2019t imagine living past this year.\n\nAnyways, this post itself is prove that I had no business being a nurse. I\u2019ve never thought of hurting someone else, and helping others did bring me joy but reading this just makes it even more obvious how incompetent I am. ",

    "Content":"I can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019ve attempted before but failed. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t done it again since it was painful and I\u2019m scared of what happens after life even though it can\u2019t be worse than this. No one besides my family has ever loved me as much as I love them. I am autistic, depressed, anxious, and have ptsd. It feels like I have a shitty hand. We can euthanize animals if they are suffering but not people. I recently got out of a year relationship and I miss him. I fucked it up. I want to distance myself from everyone so it hurts them less. Everyone would eventually get over me. I don\u2019t have access to firearms so it would have to be an overdose again but I\u2019m terrified to get it wrong and suffer more. My body feels like it\u2019s giving up as well as my mind. I can\u2019t function and work and go to college. ",

    "Content":"In 2021, everything in my life got fucked up. The results of the happening's in 2021, caused the next 4 years of my life to get ruined as well, Present day 03\/31\/2025. My life has only been getting worse and worse, day by day its sonething new. Let me explain how life was before 2021, and how life was after 2021, to compare and contrast, and to show you where my life is now. \n\n2006-2014 I was getting bullied in pre and middle school and had no friends, saw many 8th graders wth girlfriends but I was the quiet awkward kid that was just made fun of, so I didnt even fathom it for me to be a possibility in this lifetime to have a relationship of any kind, which is how fucked up i was from how these kids treated me. \n\nThen come 2015 high school starts, I don't get bullied but I don't have friends or any place to sit by lunch, so I let shit ride out, I try to get put on benzos for my panic attacks but the doctors won't prescribe benzos to children under 18, so I just deal with the crippling anxiety and panic attacks until I get a schedule change to start in January of 2016.\n\n2016 starts, and who do I see in my new math class, the kid who used to bully me in middle school, but the funniest part is we started chopping it up and we became good friends, to this present day 2025 hes my closest best friend. He introduced me into his friend group and let me sit at their table, he'd also introduced me into trying weed, which i ended up enjoying, and try to smoke as often as I can lmao, we enjoyed the summer of 2016, and even despite not even kissing or having sex with a girl in my life ever(unlike my bestfriend and his friends) I had friends and i belonged so I didn't care, then 2017 arrived it was pretty much the same thing minus the friendgroup who'd abandoned me and my bestfriend, as well as my bestfriends girl leaving my bestfriend for one of the people in the friendgroup which was no longer our friend group. So we hung around a bunch of Randoms my bestfriend was involved with drug dealing wise or just for company. Enough of 2017, moving onto to 2018. \n\n2018 was the year I met the first girl I fell in love with, we kissed once lmao, and then after that she tried to ghost me because she didn't like the way i kissed, then after fucking a bunch of other guys, she walks up to me in the hallway like nothing happens and tries to be on talking terms, having no one else is fold, so we talk and she starts dropping hint like \"i could teach you how to kiss\" and etc. I brushed it all off because part of me hated this beatfriend with benefits  \nposition she was trying to put me in, knowing how much I truly loved her. While she'd coochie coo with me and then get her back blown out by like 3 guys behind my back. But I still had feeling for her so I'd talk to her everyday, even when I didn't want to, she was the reason I had so much stress and went from smoking on weekends to a few times throughout the day 24\/7. She had changed me in a bad way, much more depressed. \n\n2019 came, i got my first car ever, but my bestfriend being a fucking dumb ass, decided to drive the car behind my back and ended up wrecking it, it was a bmw with 14 thousand miles only. It was like brands new. I had it for literally 3 days, I was depressed about it, but life happens and eventually I got over it. I went to Florida that summer with my best friend. Had fun working at a sushi place, played basketball in the summer, did many enjoyable things to forget.\n\nThen 2020 came, probably the most peaceful enjoyable year of my life. I got a new car which was faster and the same price as the one that crashed. I started talking to the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on, we started off as friends but it was becoming something more, she was a little weird, like sitting at home not leaving her room type, but her beautiful face, her personality, and to not sound perverse, but god given body were 3 thibgs to make this girl a solid 11\/10. But then one day my barber was drunk on the job and gave me the wrong fucked up hair cut, so I couldn't ask her out anymore. Months passed by we were still talking everyday, but eventually I realized this is all she wanted. Someone to talk to non stop on the phone, she didn't want to feel real intimacy, real connection, touch, things required for both men and women. So I just let it fade away until we mutually stopped talking together, but while we were talking together, I had lost my virginity(or the only time I've had sex in my life up to this date) while I was talking to the amazing girl I was mentioning above. And all I could think was, it should of have been her, we'll call the first girl(heartbreaker) nyeria, the second girl i actually liked(angel) nichelle, and the girl I lost my virginity too and have never had sex after that(skank)cam. I moved into my best friends grandmas house briefly for like 2 months but it didn't work out being it was a studio.\n\nThose were the years which I thought everything would start becoming better year by year, I had many goals for 2021, but you'll see the downfall start now \n\nOn December 31st 2020, I was burned on accident by a pot of boiling hot pasta water, went to the clinic and everything was fine, I was still healthy and had no problems at this point at my life, everything in my life was organized, from my belongings to my mind(the most important part) \nThen after my leg healed up I started to feel this power within myself, this strong positivity and confidence, like I was on top of the world, I felt more sharp, and focused, healthier, and way happier. I started working out like crazy for the first time in my life, and upon checking my alternative snap, I see that \"nyeria\" added me, so I add her and despite my displeasure, I still had feeling so I started talking to her, she still wanted to have sex and I was finally ready, just needed to get some viagra. 2021 was starting off strong (or so i thought lmao, could not have been more wrong) I rode with the feeling, and then things started happening, like people who'd never give me respect would give me respect, I'd get nice free stuff I'd never even asked for, red-lights would keep turning green, cats would weirdly move out of my way. A series of stuff happening to me that had never really happened before... EVER, so I get into it too much and start watching these spiritual youtubers on YouTube and start taking the things they're saying seriously and trying to apply it to how my life is, sone of it was true some of it wasn't. But ultimately I now feel like im the spiritual man with power, so I start acting a little irrationally. At this point with the power i \"felt i was feeling\" i didnt care about having sex with that girl, even she was my first kiss and first girl I fell in love with etc. It didn't matter at that point, I just felt like more important things were happening. So I stopped smoking weed because the way i was feeling, it couldn't even get me high, I get $50 exactly from someone for something that I used to buy this psychedelic substance called mad honey(because ib my mind i thought the price of the mad honey being $50 and me having $50 meant i was supoosed to purchase this assuming taking mad honey was a part of my spiritual quest. This is the point where everything goes down hill. I take the mad honey and trip hard and attacked my mom, there was no severe damage but I had saw demons and I was scared beyond my life and after attacking her, I somehow end up in my bedroom with lights off bolting outta bed every 10 seconds thinking I'm out of the trip, but I'm still in it, so then officers arrive and crowd into my room and make me get on an ambulance, i get discharged the same day.  Then my dad is rampant of looking for weed rehabs for me so he starts dragging me to these retarded fucking weed rehabs, I think like a good 3 or 4 of them, until I got tired and fed up with visiting those rehabs i wasnt going to go to and decided I'd just live on the road with my parents credit card, so I packed up my script benzos, script codeine and promethazine lean, my hydrocodone, and alcohol in a bag, plus my basketball, and just dipped on them and went to the double tree(who ended up not charging us) then I left the double tree to go to court for my speeding ticket. After that, I made the hugest mistake of my life #1. Follow this Maserati to ask car shop, literally only to ask him where the dispensary is so i could get a med card(being 20 at the time, the bad ugly mother fucking and his demented fat friend made me spell it on a posted note, and I waited for them to come back when in reality I should've just dipped and never came back, instead I was greeted by Lombard police forcing me to get out my car and get onto a fucking ambulance and then for the first time in my life stay at a mental hospital for like 3-4 days I think. I then got out and was sent to this place rosecrance which was very nice. Great all you can eat food, we got cigarettes, pretty counselor, chill guys, nothing really to worry about, but I was a little manic thinking strange thibgs in my head and they could notice it, so they sent me to the mental health facility of rosecrance sons other place, it was alright but nothing as good as the other rosecrance was. In hindsight, I should've just sticked it out and got my head together, figured out I'm not a supernatural guy, or my moms evil, or my dads some type of god, whatever weird shit was going on in my head, but none of this weird shit would've started in my head if these nice coincidences happen, like wanting nicotine and not even looking the girls way and 2 seconds later she offers you nicotine, or girls being sweet on me who would have never before, getting free pizza from the guy who's never done that from the 10 years I had known him at that point(14 now) or the many other things I could mention but have decided to leave it for the sake of getting on with the story. So I asked my parents to pick me up and get me out this rehab place, they reluctantly did. I had odd behavior, like going in the oasis(like a rest area but better) and walking in without my mask because I felt my power could protect me. When we got home my perception was just skewed, I saw my dad as some kind of god like person and my mom as a demonic person. I would just do little harmless weird things around the house. So one day i text nyeria a bunch of hurtful things and she blocks me, i do ot hecause im sexretly convinced shes a demon of some kind or my secret hapf sister no ones told us about, she did kind of look like me. So one day i make the mistake of unadding a bunch people on snapchat, because I'm thinking that they're demons or people on the dark side... I removed \"nichelle\" of my snapchat, the girl I liked the absolute most more than anyone, the girl im still in love with to this day. The most beautiful perfect girl in this world. While I was in my mind state I didnt think anything of it. So the damage i had caused myself had been bad but was undeniably gonna become worse, lost an easy good looking bootycall, and lost the love of my life who i was waiting for the right time to rekindle things with, but becoming manic can happen outta nothing. So the next day my mom makes food and I'm paranoid she's poisoned it, and try to throw it outside, but my dad stops me, he then tells me were going a trip, he lies and brings me to the mental hospital, where this faggot tall fat big pussy bitch forces me to strip into a gown or hell get people to hold me down and do it. They then leave me in that hospital for 10 days with multiple fucked antipsychotics that don't help me feel less antisychotic, because in reality, I was just a boy on the Autism spectrum drawing conclusions from coincidences or special stuff that normally doesn't happen to the extent of it happening being crazy in my eyes leading me to think from one thing to another forming nonsensical ideas and skewing my perception. All the antipsychotics did was make me gain weight, get headaches, and make me depressed. After I got out of hospital #2 my dad told me in the car he'd threw out $5000+ worth of my codeine and promethazine syrup, that I was going to be forced to go to outpatient for weed even i hadn't been smoking it for like a month, and he had kept my car in someone's driveway for a couple months \"till I deserve it again\" almost forgot, he rearranged my room and threw away a bunch of my weed paraphernalia, other stuff that was important to me not related to weed. Then he started forcing me to get vaccinated, I told him a hundred times I'd won't but he'd keep bothering me like on some really obsessive creepy shit, so after a month of bothering, I went against my fears and got one shot only, never any after that. I regretted it so much, and I was someone mad about putting that fucked up poison in my body especially after everything i had already went through, this was the worst thing, because i could've lost relationships with beautiful women, i could've lost material possessions, money, designer drugs, and privilege of using a car, but my health was the most important thing to me, and they fucked that for me, those stupid fucking scared Indians want to shove needles up their ass and get blood clots a d cancer and die cuz they're fuxkibg stupid and don't understand thr vaccine was solely created to kill us, I was forced into taking it by them, so the love i had for my father disappeared, I hated him now for fucking my life up. \n\nThen 2022 came, I moved out and was chronically depressed since 2021, which is when it started May 16th,2021 after I got the vaccine. I couldn't look my friends in the eyes anymore have full conversations, feel present, smoke weed without getting anxiety, thinking about how i lost nyeria and nichelle(these are made up names to protect their real identities) I was slightly fat. The main thing i enjoyed doing was smoking weed and after the trauma of losing my lean, weed stuff, car, the 2 girls i could've had in my life, my health due to the vaccine, it was all too much so I just stayed away from weed from that point, until like a week later I fell into a pit of buying dispensary dab carts and poshes(vapes) and smo king them everyday ro ease my pain, and not see my parents. But to sum it up my bestfriends house was too dirty to stay in, so I moved out and started hanging out with the spiritual kid who made me lose 30 pounds, and things were going good until the feeling of power came back, I started not only feeling this new feeling of power, but a new add to the mix was that my mom was lightskin black and somehow I was gabgmember and part of the black p stones. I really in my mind drew this conclusion outta things that I really don't want to get into right now, but that was the case \n\n2023 was the same, living of the idea my \"real\" mom is a gangmember and my \"fake\" real mom is my stepmother, I just drove around not doing shit, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, doing drugs, the same old,(by the way i had a job in 2022 around the time i started losing my marbles again, but that doesn't matter.\") One day i decide to do stunts in the basement and injure my shoulder, then when I come home I'm getting this special sense that I need to jump off the balcony, so i do; and in that exact moments the cop arrives, sick of their bs i don't want to respond to them, i didn't hurt anyone and its not their house so they can go fuck themselves, so basically I get intuition that I need to go to jail to by myself so I just punch the officer and end up going to jail where some of the deputy's treat me like a king, and some treat me like the garbage they themselves are (example beebee) but his son the other beebee was cool. Wrong, grote, strezlecki, the goats no one better than them. But then in November 2023 I get transferred to a fucking mental psych ward near Missouri \n\nThey say I have pschitzoeffective, which i never did and don't, and put ke on fuckec up halidol and depakote where the haldol made me go from 144 pounds 5'11 to 189 pounds 5'11. Worse than that, every single day I'd get these out of body side effects, which were like going through hell times 11. But there was nothing I could do there. They beat people up there, and it was one to get beaten on the suspicion that I was spitting out my poisin medication but really it was my phlegm. There were many other bad things about but I'm not really going to go over those rn, have questions dm me. So 8 months in jail, 6 months in the hospital I'm out on bond, before I get accepted into mental health probation. The terms of my probation are driving all the way up to Wheaton twice a week just to piss, multiple court dates, probation officer meeting, and no drugs of any kind including alcohol, unless you can get a med card but i doubt mental health probation will allow that. Hopefully im through with probation ny November 16th 2025. I'm sick all of this shit \n\nSo this is where I'm at present, i have completed no college, I used to get women in the past, but with all of the trauma I been through i hate myself and dont see myself seeking the comfort of any woman in this life time, i was 195 pounds with a big gut, my dad crashed my car while I was in jail so now I have no car, the whole reason I went to the jail and became a viral video with over 100 million views is hecause my parents decided to call the cops and new I was unstable and would do something to them to end up in jail, I lost the 2 only girls that I could've had any relationship with, my confidence is ruined from going to jails and hospitals. They're trying to lable me as Schitzo-effective and prescribe me those fucked up meds like haldol or abilify which have side effect like weight gain, head aches, and out of body attacks(being the worst side effext), and erectile dysfunction. I actually stopped taking those pills 2 months ago completely, and i still have erectyle dysfunction.I don't need these medications when I'm just a normal depressed guy realizing that I had lost my mind twice, and have come to terms wirh it. I lost my $5000 in codeine lean, I don't enjoy music anymore, i feel an empty void in my life, i have no motivation for living anymore, I hate myself and I have no self confidence, i don't look good anymore, I can barely get my dick up, I can't talk to girls, only ones I had a connection with and they're both gone forever. I'm stuck on probation, I'm 24 without a car, I'm fat depressed and overweight with erectile dysfunction, my psychiatrist i trying to stop lorazepam(the only medication which is supposed to be for my anxiety and pannic attacks) I don't want to be alive anymore, so much of my life has gone to shit, there's so much I didnt mention in these paragraphs because it was hard to incorporate the whole story. I am missing about 40%. So try to go off what you read. I keep praying we will get one redo with life, but it just doesn't seem possible, but at the same time, it does. Before 2021 I had everything i needed, I had the perfect life, not a single complaint, my body was right and my mind even righter, it's just sad to watch thibgs crumble before your very eyes. Have something beautiful, and just watch it turn completely to shit. I could've had any better relationship with my family. I would've had women in my life. I would have had my personal belongings, which meant a lot to me. I would've had my car. I would've been. In good health and in good shape, plus looked good too, I would've interest in my life, anx motivation to move forward, but i have none of that anymore.\n\nMy fellow human beings, do you feel we get one more redo at life from birth, to do everything right and perhaps make different or better mistakes, not the fucked up ones we made in this lifetime, I know it sounds stupid as fuck, but deep down I can't be the only one feeling this way, with a desire for a redo at life.\n\nMaybe we're just better of killing ourselves, who even knows, because i can't keep going on with this life.\n",

    "Title":"A digital suicide note for the future.",
    "Content":"I\u2019m writing this because I don\u2019t want a physical suicide note, first of all if it\u2019s physical then I\u2019m scared that somebody will find it ; if it\u2019s digital then anybody who I know only online, like my friends Mimi and this specific girl could find it and maybe tell my other online friends. \n\nI plan on taking my life soon, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be successful. I\u2019ve tried three times, I said I\u2019ll try three more times some other day ; sense six is my lucky number, if I survive the sixth attempt I\u2019ll stop or at least try to. I won\u2019t be attempting again until this weekend most likely, I don\u2019t want to kill myself on a weekday. \n\nI am Mateo, I\u2019m half Mexican and half Turkish. I am a transgender man and if I am referred to anything but a man once I\u2019m dead ; if I\u2019m buried in anything that isn\u2019t a suit, then you\u2019d be disrespecting me and not laying me to rest in the way I\u2019d like to be. I\u2019m straight. \n\nLife ;\nI was abused as a child, I\u2019ve brung it up to my parents but clearly they don\u2019t remember it ; but I do. It was an average day for them but to me it wasn\u2019t, I was abused verbally, physically and sexually. I was given hickeys as a child, I can\u2019t remember who did it but I was also raped as a child\u2014 which is why my period started so early and I was forced into a early puberty. My mother would hit me across my face for crying and once my father tried to drag me outside while yelling at me as I cried, he would try and hit me too. I\u2019ve been groped as a child and more that I don\u2019t want to go into details with, once my school stripped searched me without the permission of myself or my family. A lot happened that I just can\u2019t talk about, I was also bullied as a child.\n\nCome my teenage years, I was sexually groomed online several times. I realized I was transgender in elementary school which is why from such an early age I was self conscious and such. Freshman year I had zero friends and would try to kill myself everyday in school, I\u2019d skip class just to cry in a bathroom stall or hang myself with my own jacket. I suspect I\u2019m both mentally ill and disabled, I took these suspicions to my parents but they did nothing to help me and my mother just looked at me with zero sympathy when I asked for help because I suspected I had depression. I believe I\u2019m both depressed and neurodivergent, possibly autism. I have been refused and never got the help I needed to better myself mentally, I have had to help myself and only myself all this time. \n\nI have felt isolated and lonely my entire life, this world is cruel and has shown me that it lacks humanity and empathy. The human race are not humans, they are monsters that only care about themselves but they want to believe they are humans ; they are robots without any personality, any unique beliefs, anything at all. Nothing.\n\nOn December 30th of 2023 I got with the most perfect woman alive, I won\u2019t be naming her in this and if I\u2019m successful in my attempt ; do not search for her. Let her be by herself, I don\u2019t want her to know if I\u2019m dead or not. I love her a lot, I don\u2019t want to call it a separation but we parted I guess on March 21st of this year (2025) and I feel like I lost everything, I lost the hope I regained for my future. She made me forget all that trauma and move on, now it\u2019s all back. It\u2019s not her fault, I\u2019ve always been this way and I\u2019ve tried to kill myself several times during our relationship for reasons not related to her, I\u2019ve always been a depressed person. I\u2019m scared she\u2019s not coming back and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m strong enough to wait and see if she\u2019ll come back. I love her a lot, she feels like the only true human on Earth besides me. I feel real, everybody else doesn\u2019t ; everything else doesn\u2019t feel real BUT her. I feel like an extinct animal that met another one of his species just for her to get hunted down.\n\nI lost her, I lost a future. I don\u2019t have hope for myself anymore, I did for a little over a year thanks to her but without her I really am nothing. I don\u2019t want her to come back if it\u2019s because I\u2019m going to kill myself, I want her to come back if she loves me enough to. \n\nI have no future, I\u2019ve always been stupider than others because I\u2019m suspicious of myself that I have a learning disability, no matter how hard I try ; I fall back. I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t survive in a teenage world, so how will I survive in an adult one? I want a closed casket funeral, bury me. Do not turn me into ashes, jewels or anything like that. Let me die in my casket and let me rest for now.\n\nThis is not a permanent solution to temporary problems, this is a permanent solution to a permanent problem. The one thing I\u2019ve wanted consistently since I was a child was to be dead. I\u2019m writing this while in class, just in case. \n\nGive all my money to a transgender or Muslim charity. \n\nBurn my art and my school books, donate my clothes and do whatever you\u2019d like with anything I have in my room. I don\u2019t care. Treat my dog Chucha nicely, don\u2019t yell at her and don\u2019t hit my dog Chucha. I don\u2019t love any of you but M.A, I hope that I pay for my sins quickly in the afterlife and make it to a heaven where I\u2019m able to live the life I wanted to with her. \n\nDo not write my birth name anywhere on a gravestone or something, write \u201cMateo\u201d. Please. \n\nGoodbye, if I have a funeral then make the music my metal playlist on Spotify for fun. Don\u2019t invite my Uncle, don\u2019t kiss or hug anything of mines. Let me die. ",

    "Content":"My life is fucking awful. All of my friends have left me one by one for being trans. My dad isnt supportive of me and i have no one anymore. I did have a girlfriend who i loved and im sure cared about me, but lately things have just gotten so overwhelming, scary and just awful to the point where ik staying with her would only be harmful and i want her to have a good life. Since in addition to being well suicidal i have mental illnesses that will never go away. I dont want her to have to suffer with that for the rest of her life. So i did the only thing i could think of. I \"cheated\" on her by basically doing like a \"looking a partner\" type of account and making it very obvious it was me. Posting a picture I had sent her only a few days ago. Also made sure it was the same name as my username on other platforms so she would maybe find it. My plan was to slowly get her to maybe find it. Slightly nudge her towards the right direction, but well. Turns out she found it only a couple hours after creation (lucky?). She has now broken up with me and is extremely mad at me (since well you know cheaters are fucking awful). And i can finally just.. disappear. Without anyone caring or maybe even noticing. So yeah silly little rambling. Also empty account cause posting this from somewhere she wont see it.",

I've been depressed for years and my complete heartbreak even thinking about how my parents and sister would be after losing me has always kept me from doing it. I had the worst relationship with my mother ever, I don't talk to her anymore but still I know she would suffer and it would absolutely destroy my dad and sister.\n\nBut. Lately I can't take the thought that they would understand me after having seen everything that happened if I decided to end it. It would be sad I know it would for them, but this new approach Im having is a really big change and I feel like I've crossed a line maybe? Like I'm actually at the risk of planning things and not feeling like I'm a monster for doing this to them. ",

    "Content":"I am in a college level programme, I have no interest in. No, nobody forced me to be here, I one day told my parents I want to be xyz, and here I am. But the reality is, I suspect I have ADHD (Yes, I tried to go for diagnosis but stepped out of it coz sudden anxiety kicked in, will try a few months later), and my ADHD, one, hates repetitive tasks, like studying, and two, is fucking burnt out on studies. And yes, I have tried every possible study method under the sun, but eventually I end up abandoning studies every damn time.\n\nSo, as happens with anyone who does not study for years in a college program, I have been failing for years, back to back, and every time it breaks me more and more. Somehow, the ADHD dead-end love kicks in right before teh supplementary exams, and I pass in those, barely. This last year, I tried to seek help by talking to close friend, and also trying to get ADHD diagnosis, but that brought all the sorrow I had kept hidden behind my multiple daily distractions that ran me when I was avoiding every damn morsel of studying.\n\nWith that sudden inflow of sorrowful pangs, in came multiple self harming thoughts. Earlier, before the floodgates of sorrow opened, it was like, may some car come and hit me, or may this fan fall on me. But last year, while writing an exam, when I knew nothing, I had this urge to just put the pen through my neck and end it all. I somehow came out of it, and never had any such episode.\n\nA few days back, my final results came in. I couldn't check the results, as I was with my parents, travelling back from a wildlife inhabited area, results declared but can't check coz mum was beside me, I so wanted a large animal like a giraffe or an elephant to show up and end it all, in one massive flip of the car. For anybody thinking, YES, I failed again. A few days later, on my trip back home, the constant thought of \"Jump in front of the train\" kept coming again and again to my mind. I somehow walked out of that too, but this was the first time such thoughts came again in the same week.\n\nEverything feels futile, I don't want to study, I am just continuing for the sake of completing this programme, as it is a very prestigious one and there are thousand eyes looking at me, with hopes and expectations. But, all of it seems like a wasteland to me, and I just feel like abandoning all of it, and running off to a place of solitude, as I have never had a moment of being alone by myself, and I crave for it, but can't attain it until I live on my money, this programme I am trying to run out of, will give me good money, but it is eating me inside out.\n\nI have been raised with the belief that suicide is a sin, and that it is not to be commited in any circumstance, is that what is holding me from taking the wrong step, or something else, I don't know, but it is a fragile thread.",

    "Content":"I was a couple of modules shy of my degree, I was gaining momentum during covid. The university is corrupt. I just wanted to finish my degree it was alot of work and drama and sunk cost fallacy. I was nearly done finally my exams were deliberately sabotaged by my colleagues. They pressed me to do a law degree. Im not bad at it and its a large volume of work but not taxing really. I just wanted to leave my country. If I get this qualification it will take until 2030 to get qualified. Even if I am qualified that means that I can't practice anywhere else and I will be 50+ effectively not employable.I have no money. I am recovering from an antipsychotic. I am tapering now. I have been trying although my brain and memory is shot. ",
